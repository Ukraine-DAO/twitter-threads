This is an opinion piece. I didn’t get any *belling cat-style* fancy documents, just talked to a bunch of people, so you can always call it fake news.

Well, for me it’s most certainly not. Witnesses from different times and places either didn’t know about the guy or told the exact same story.

The story of [@officejjsmart](https://twitter.com/officejjsmart), who claimed he was more than he actually was.

I am not a journalist, I am a Twitter personality and a marketing expert with a lot of friends working in media and politics. An interesting period of my youth was dedicated to  US election campaigns.

This combination of interests triggered my bullshit sensor the very moment I read something from Jay Jay. Am I not the only one who is not a journalist here?

The second strike was way more… Striking. My Ukrainian friend, a great person who made a lot for the country told me that she was being attacked by some Kyiv Post journalist. This American dude claimed my friend is “not a real Ukrainian”.

The third (final) strike came when Jay Jay tried to act intimidating with a well-known Ukraine supporter. Now Mr. Smart was let's say "not supportive at all".

Quote: Know what’s funny? When I write a story - I’m legally obligated to use your real name. So, when I say that you live at X town in O state, its needed for transparency purposes. To get both sides of the story, I’d be sure to ask your employer their view, too.

This approach got even more aggressive in DM's with the guy he attacked: 
So, [REAL NAME], - need your comments for a story I’m writing. I’ve already sent emails to your employer. And am requesting your records. But I’d love to hear your side of the story.

That’s how Jay Jay got into my spotlight. The number of claims made by the guy and his fans was absurdly impressive. A lot of experience in russian politics. Worked with leaders of russian opposition. Persona Non-Grata in multiple countries including Russia. What a biography!

My favorite part was this. His fans kept harassing me with this: did you check already? And now? And now?

So I had no choice but to run through the Linkedin profile and follow history. I didn't take the early campaigns because it's tough to find any people but I had some pleasure to talk with McCain '08 campaign managers.

Most of them didn't remember the guy (3 out of 4). Luckily I found one person, who described him as "some young PR guy". That was close to my own conclusion. As a marketing person, I can describe his position as a mid-tier project manager with a great talent for job descriptions.

I am not kidding about the talent. Can you put "had e-mails" in three bullet points? Mr. Smart does it with style. 
And that's how we move to his most interesting period (for me at least). IRI.

There I found some people who (finally) remember JJ. My biggest question "How did he get a Persona Non-Gratta status?" was finally answered. 
"He just didn't get a long-term visa, like most people from IRI at that point, he is the same PNG I am".

Another PNG episode happened in Uzbekistan. According to my sources, JJ asked the driver to cut the road through disputed territories at night and got arrested. The next day he was kicked out of the country with an actual PNG status. Not so heroic but at least true.

People from IRI I talked to say the same in different words: The guy does know how to sell himself, and he constantly tries to do so. In the process, he doesn't care about the truth too much. So if he was that important, actual opposition leaders should know something about him?

I asked a lot of people. I asked the guys who worked with Navalny during this period. I asked Dozhd guys. I finally reached out to Boris Nemtsov's press secretary. No, they didn't hear about the brave guy who made so much for Russia.

Does that mean, he lies and never worked where he worked? No. Of course, he did. But as his colleague tells: 
"Consequently, every promotion he ever got, built his own personal legend and ego, till you see who is out there now".
