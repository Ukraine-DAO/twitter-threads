Russian Imperial Movement - Русское Имперское Движениe

A brief overview of the Russian neo-Nazi organization Russian Imperial Movement (RIM), founded in 2002.  The organization is officially recognized as a terrorist group by the US and Canada.

The Stanford Center for International Security and Cooperation published an extensive report on the organization in February 2021. It is a deep dive into the org's history, activities, and motivations. I'll summarize a few key dates. [MMP: Russian Imperial Movement](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/mappingmilitants/profiles/russian-imperial-movement)

2002: the group is formed with the sole goal of rebuilding the Russian Empire within its pre-1914 borders and reinstating the monarchy. The initial membership is very low.
2002-2011: the group grows as does its political influence. Xenophobia, antisemitism, overt ethnocentrism on Русские (ethnic Russians) are embraced by the group. The group takes part in the Russian Marches, ultra-right rallies (NB: Navalny attended these rallies). The group also joins rallies held by the principal party of the country, United Russia.

2012-February 2014: RIM attempts to join other groups to form a registered political party. Nothing comes to fruition. While retaining its ultra-right views, RIM seeks "to participate in the broad democratic opposition to the Russian regime by building relationships with...

more mainstream groups." The group grows its far-right network while attending opposition rallies. 
February 28, 2014: Vorobyev, RIM founder, and several other members of the group appear in Crimea as Russia annexes the peninsula; the group aligns with the authorities.

2014-2015: 2014 is a turning point for RIM. The group expands and sets up a military wing, the Imperial Legion. The Legion takes an active part in the denied Russian invasion of the Donbas. RIM starts collaborating with Rodina, you may have seen its leader [twitter.com/MuKappa/status…](https://twitter.com/MuKappa/status/1530555464454397954?s=20&t=RBJSTslLfFaSOeyWl5Y51g)

Multiple training camps are set up in Russia to train the Imperial Legion's fighters. RIM starts expanding its international network. 
2016-2017: RIM pulls out of Ukraine after Minsk II. RIM trains foreign fighters in Russia that conduct a series of terror attacks in Sweden.

RIM establishes connections with far-right groups in the US, including Nazi Traditionalist Workers’ Party. 2018-February 2022: The Imperial Legion makes appearances in Syria and Lybia, fighting for Russian-backed dictators and warlords. RIM membership grows to several thousand.

RIM has a website rusimperia(.)is. The website is currently unavailable, but the Wayback Machine archived a copy as of May 2022. Let's have a look at what they are saying about themselves. Select translations follow.

"of the blood kind of the Russian Empire and of the spiritual kind from the Roman Empire.
The creation of a new Russian Empire in the image of the Third Rome is not only a call of the times but also the only way to save the ethnic Russian people."

The path to salvation of the ethnic Russian people is through "God, tsar, ethnicity" according to RIM. 
"The central pillar of the Empire was Orthodoxy. The value of a state, in the eyes of God, is determined by faithfulness to His commandments.

"We, the ethnic Russians, the second people chosen by God in human history, have to draw lessons from our predecessors, the spiritual ones - the Hebrews and Romans, and the blood ones, the ethnic Russians, who built the greatest Empire."

They continue with their take on the construct of the tsar:
"Specifically imperial (tsar's) authority is the ideal form of state governance in Orthodoxy (in the Christian kind, and the pre-Christian kind) as the divine authority is built as a Tsardom headed by a ruling Tsar."

They also provide a summary of their own history. Their self-reported history starts before 2002. The first assembly of monarchic movements happened in St. Petersburg in 1991. In 1993 the monarchists defended the Russian White house against Yeltsin's forces...

during the Constitutional Crisis of 1993. In the late 1990s they actively took part in the beatification of the Tsar's family. In 2002, after multiple transformations, the monarchists formed the Russian Imperial Movement. 
The website also offers a way to join RIM.

The application form asks for the applicant's first and last name, patronymic, date of birth, city of residence, ethnicity, religious views, interest in activities, email, and phone number.

Another interesting section of the website covers their various "projects." One of their "projects" is Defense:
"- The defense of the Christian Church from the most aggressive adversaries.
- As part of this project we take part in the fight in the Middle East and Northern...

"- Military and athletic preparation, remote teaching of safety basics
- Governing the veteran organization of "Novorossiya veterans. Union of volunteers who fought the Ukrainian separatists in Ukraine."

Read carefully the last bullet point. Novorossiya is an imperial term for Ukraine's South and East. Also, note how Ukraine's regular forces are called "separatists" - RIM does not view Ukraine as a sovereign country, but as a "pseudo-state."

Let's look at their Telegram channel now. The channel was created on July 6, 2017. It has fewer than 1500 subscribers but seems to be a legitimate RIM channel. In their first post, they complain about the crackdown by Russia's Roskomnadzor on the extreme far-right media outlets.

In a five-part post, they explain their origins and their part in the war in Donbas in 2014-2015. It is at times incoherent and adds nothing of value beyond the Stanford report and their own website. However, they provide some useful size estimates for multiple units in the post.

On July 13, 2017, though the group was no longer involved in the plausible deniability phase of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, RIM called for enrollment into the Partizan intensive training course, possibly implying recruitment into the Imperial Legion. [Русское Имперское Движение](https://t.me/Rus_imperia/11)

The course is only 7 days long, 12 hours a week and includes live fire exercises, map reading, radio comms, urban warfare, and first aid training. Much like Rusich, RIM uses St. Petersburg as their primary city for training.

It is no secret that the group is extremely racist, xenophobic, and antisemitic. On 02.15.2022 Ukraine passed the legislation criminalizing antisemitism, with 295 for votes. RIM commented: "Now we know for certain how many Jews there are in the Rada. 295." [Русское Имперское Движение](https://t.me/Rus_imperia/9329)

They reposted this video to their channel with the following comment: "I wonder, do Russia's Hassids and Chabad support this 'flashmob?'" [Русское Имперское Движение](https://t.me/Rus_imperia/9439) [pic.twitter.com/r2qGUJs0T4](https://twitter.com/MuKappa/status/1542485812645957636/video/1)

They do not shy away from using the slurs against the Jews (yes, that word k***). For example:

On February 24, 2022, on the day of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, RIM posted their commentary. [Русское Имперское Движение](https://t.me/Rus_imperia/9359)
"If a country faced with a choice between war and shame chooses shame, then it gets both war and shame. W. Churchill.
In a civil war any victory...

"is a defeat. Lucian.

So, war.
Today we all woke up to the news that we've been waiting for 3 months already. Perhaps even 8 years. The RF has launched an operation across the entire border with Ukraine. Do we welcome this war? Well of course - Yes!...

"It is an inevitable evil. Whether it going to resolve the civil war among the ethnic Russian people, that started 100 years ago, is doubtful. We wake up again as if on a groundhog day. As if we are reading Bulgakov's "The white guard." More than a hundred years passed,...

"and we are still in the same spot. The same Ukrainian directory, the same Entente, just called differently. In 2014 we started this war. The Russian volunteers. Then we had an opportunity to finish the war in a short period. Now there is none. I'll say it to all our comrades...

"There is nothing to be happy about! In 2014-2016 we lost this war. The Legion. The Partizan Center lost 12 brothers in arms. Is Russia's new offensive vengeance? Maybe. We unequivocally support the liquidation of the separatist formation called Ukraine, created with the sole...

"wisdom to use the resource efficiently. ALL must be ready!
Denis Gariev, director of the Partizan Center for tactical and live-fire training."

RIM is also promoting the standard historic revisionism employed by Russia at large. In this post, [Русское Имперское Движение](https://t.me/Rus_imperia/9473), they start off by saying that "The Russian Cities, What do they have to do with Ukraine?" and many Ukrainian cities with their supposed "Russian" origin.

They also resonate with DShRG Rusich's interpretation of their motivations for the war: "For ethnic Russians, the principal enemy is a Russophobe. It does not matter what their ethnicity is. Even if they are a former ethnic Russian, regrouped into an Okrainian. And it does not...

"Ethnic Russians always return what is theirs. Including Kiev, the mother of all Russian cities, and Russian Galicia, and we are not even talking about Novorossiya which we cleansed from the Turks. And we shall cleanse these lands from the Ukro-occupants." [Русское Имперское Движение](https://t.me/Rus_imperia/9467)

It is a short but dense post by RIM: 
1. Russophoboes are the enemy
2. "Okrainian," not a typo, means someone living on the outskirts (of the Empire). Intentional warping of "Ukrainian"
3. They need to be killed, the use of the Untermenschen is acceptable

4. "Ukro-separatists" are occupying Russian lands.
5. Ethnic cleansing and genocide are acceptable means to them, as they did it before. 
It is not the only post calling for extreme measures.

RIM is calling for using anything possible as a weapon, including:
- Grain ([Русское Имперское Движение](https://t.me/Rus_imperia/9631))
- Genocide ([Русское Имперское Движение](https://t.me/Rus_imperia/9501) [Русское Имперское Движение](https://t.me/Rus_imperia/9530))
- POW executions ([Русское Имперское Движение](https://t.me/Rus_imperia/9607))
- Hiring the North Koreans ([Русское Имперское Движение](https://t.me/Rus_imperia/9692))
- And other insanities

On March 24 they announced the deployment of the Imperial Legion's units to the frontline in Ukraine. A deca (unit type) under the command of Consul Dionysus of the Imperial Legion was sent; however, the Legion did not yet announce their general mobilization.

RIM and their Imperial Legion are subordinate to the Russian MOD by their own admission. By their own admission, they also seem to be experiencing a manpower shortage. Source: [Русское Имперское Движение](https://t.me/Rus_imperia/9689)

RIM also recently posted an article expressing their frustration with the authorities: the lack of an ideology (according to them Russia should openly declare ethnic Russian exceptionalism) and the stated goals of the war ("denazification," echoes Rusich). [Русское Имперское Движение](https://t.me/Rus_imperia/9663)

RIM also posts sometimes sympathetic messages to the Third Reich and its collaborators, especially the so-called Russian Liberation Army (ROA). Source: [Русское Имперское Движение](https://t.me/Rus_imperia/9628)

For now, end of the thread.

RIM yet again declares partial mobilization. In the video, they again reiterate that those who serve in the Imperial Legion are under the patronage of the Russian MOD. They are paid and receive compensation in case of injury. They maintain their ideology. [Русское Имперское Движение](https://t.me/Rus_imperia/9704)

The Imperial Legion claims to be on the "western front," in Ukraine with a bigger contingent in a July 11 telegram post. I am not certain but I think to them Syria and Africa are considered "southern fronts." Three extra decas are now deployed in addition to the original decas.

A deca is not defined by RIM, but it is probably just ten fighters or a platoon-sized unit at most. Also, Consul Dionisys is reported to be still alive.
