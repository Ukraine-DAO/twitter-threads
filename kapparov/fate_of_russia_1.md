On the fate of Russia and a way out of the war(s) 

The talks of saving Putin’s face and not allowing him to be humiliated in this war have met some seemingly passionate pushback. [Macron: Putin shouldn’t be humiliated over ‘historic’ mistake](https://www.politico.eu/article/macron-putin-ukraine-invasion-mistake/)

However, the pushback is not emotional as such proposals show a fundamental misunderstanding of Russia and the way the nation operates and thinks. Note that to “save Putin’s face” would constitute saving Russia’s face. I will drop mentioning Putin altogether.

The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, while absurd from the Western perspective, is rational from the RU perspective. It was predicated on false assumptions including the Ukrainians not putting up fierce resistance and Europe not doing much due to... [Putin ‘purges’ 150 FSB agents in response to Russia’s botched war with Ukraine](https://bit.ly/3tG0vUP)

...their resource dependencies on Russia. The invasion is a continuation of Russia’s colonial policies that had never disappeared. And the choice of Ukraine as a target is not surprising.

Ukraine, along with the Baltic states, did not go into Moscow’s orbit after the collapse of the Soviet Union and chose to pursue a multi-vector policy. While the Baltic states obtained the NATO umbrella in 2004, Ukraine was not so fortunate. [ucm.es/data/cont/medi…](https://www.ucm.es/data/cont/media/www/pag-72509/UNISCI%20DP%2020-%20FREIRE.pdf)

Later the same year Ukraine’s Orange Revolution took place. The protests were the immediate aftermath of the presidential elections, where the results were rigged in favor of a pro-Russian candidate, Viktor Yanukovych. [The Orange Revolution](http://ti.me/1flAjPc)

In 2010 Yanukovych became president and unsurprisingly sought closer relations with Russia. In 2013 he chose the EAEU path and abandoned Ukraine’s EU membership aspirations. This decision directly contributed to the Euromaidan protests of 2013-2014. [Ukraine to Receive Observer Status Within Eurasian Customs Union](https://prn.to/3PWZReS)

Yanukovych fled to Russia in the aftermath. Russia took advantage of the situation and punished Ukraine’s Euro integration hopes with the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas.
So, what is the EAEU? The Eurasian Economic Union, aka the Customs Union.

The moniker of Таёжный Союз it got from the people of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and other former colonies highlights its colonial nature. It is a play on the official name of Таможенный Союз. The people called the Taiga Union.
Is it equivalent to the EU? No, in no way, shape, or form.

Chatham House writes: “Moscow created the EAEU as a vehicle to reverse Russia’s loss of power in the region following the demise of the Soviet Union, rather than to pursue deep economic integration with smaller states.” [Myth 10: ‘The Eurasian Economic Union is a genuine and meaningful counterpart to the EU’](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/05/myths-and-misconceptions-debate-russia/myth-10-eurasian-economic-union-genuine-and)

They add: “Russia disregards the rules of the very organization through which it seeks to reassert its power… the EAEU is dominated by Russia’s ad hoc trade policy, which involves offering favourable deals to loyal states while punishing disloyalty.”

The union has nothing to do with economic integration and everything to do with Russia’s colonial geopolitics.

Members that do not abide by Russia’s arbitrary rules get swiftly punished. For example, in 2014 to pressure Belarus into helping to bypass western sanctions Russia banned imports produced by 23 large Belarusian companies. [Лукашенко: Москва нарушает правила Таможенного союза - BBC News Русская служба](https://www.bbc.com/russian/international/2014/12/141203_lukashenko_customs_union)

The EAEU is not only a soft power projection tool but also an economic extortion scheme. Standards and requirements are optimized only for Russian producers or simply set at levels that are prohibitively costly to abide by for everyone.

Russian companies typically don’t get punished for standards violations. [Казахстан жалуется на нарушение Россией норм ЕАЭС](https://bit.ly/3MnLSfc)

Finally, 85.3% of customs duties of all imports entering the union go to Russia, independent of where in the union they enter. [Киргизия будет получать 1,9% от общей суммы таможенных поступлений в ЕАЭС](https://web.archive.org/web/20161110221126/http://eurasiancenter.ru/news/20141230/1003837902.html)

If economic vassalage does not work then brute force is applied. The first troubling signs of their aggressive colonial ambitions appeared in 2008. Using a fabricated cause Russia invaded Georgia and attempted to destroy oil pipelines bypassing Russia. [Raids Suggest Russia Targeted Energy Pipelines](https://on.wsj.com/3x9BPVA)

But most importantly the Russian invasion of Georgia canceled the construction of the Nabucco natural gas pipeline, which would have decreased Europe’s dependency on the Russian gas supply. Talks of other pipelines bypassing Russia also vanished.

The Russians were playing the long game. [bit.ly/38TDNkG](https://bit.ly/38TDNkG)
The West attempted to reset relations with Russia after the invasion of Georgia. Then-secretary of State Clinton famously presented Lavrov with a “reset” button.

| [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUmoAe2WIAMvu4M.jpg)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUmoAe2WIAMvu4M.jpg) | [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUmoAgIXwAAMRuc.jpg)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUmoAgIXwAAMRuc.jpg) |

Even that did not prophetically go as planned. The Russian word for “reset” was misspelled for “overload.” [VIDEO: Wrong red button](https://www.politico.com/story/2009/03/video-wrong-red-button-019719)

After the two wars in Chechnya, the invasion of Georgia, and numerous assassinations abroad, the reset of relations was taken as appeasement and a gesture welcoming a more aggressive foreign policy. Crimea, the Donbas, and the intervention in Syria followed.

Following Crimea and the Donbas Russia was subjected to anemic sanctions in 2014 and 2015. Ukraine and Russia first signed Minsk I to stop the fighting in the Donbas in 2014. [A Timeline Of All Russia-Related Sanctions](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-sanctions-timeline/29477179.html)

However, after the Russian victory at the Donetsk Airport, Minsk I no longer suited the Russian side and the fighting continued. Appeasement failed again. [Ukraine forces admit loss of Donetsk airport to rebels](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/21/russia-ukraine-war-fighting-east)

In February 2015 Minsk II was reached. The Russian side used the seven-year break to assemble its forces and plan for a further escalation. FSB’s Fifth Directorate, responsible for intelligence and subversion in the neighboring countries, and other Russian services reportedly received $5 billion to lay the groundwork for a full takeover of Ukraine through propaganda, double agents, subterfuge, etc. [$5 млрд в никуда: Путин хочет разобраться, почему провалилась подрывная деятельность в Украине](https://www.unian.net/war/5-mlrd-v-nikuda-putin-hochet-razobratsya-pochemu-provalilas-podryvnaya-deyatelnost-v-ukraine-novosti-vtorzheniya-rossii-na-ukrainu-11733466.html)

On February 24, 2022 the Russians decided they had sufficiently prepared for a full-scale invasion so Minsk II became another promise they broke. [twitter.com/DmytroKuleba/s…](https://twitter.com/DmytroKuleba/status/1496695889401896964?s=20&t=lRmi2cNeUimyRXVlFuAm-w)

Hence, we have a consistent pattern: every concession given (e.g. Crimea) and every agreement signed (e.g. Khasavyurt) are only taken as a sign of weakness, exploited as a window of opportunity, and lead to a further escalation of Russian appetites.

So how does one stop this cycle? First off, no concessions, no Minsk III. The Ukrainians know it. Some in the West are yet to grasp it. Ukraine must defeat the Russians on the battlefield. Western military and humanitarian aid are critical. 
[No compromise on Ukraine's territorial integrity – President's Office](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3488320-no-compromise-on-ukraines-territorial-integrity-presidents-office.html)

Second, I would argue that none of the sanctions should be lifted even if Ukraine’s territorial integrity is fully restored. In fact, a full embargo should be introduced at the earliest convenience. Russia is a colonial empire with a fragile economy. [Decolonize Russia](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/russia-putin-colonization-ukraine-chechnya/639428/)

Russia’s colonial nature was discussed ad nauseam recently. It is also no secret that Russia is heavily reliant on imports of finished goods (e.g. Speaker of Federation Council Matviyenko was recently shocked to find out that even nails are imported).
[Matvienko is surprised that Russia does not produce nails](https://www.silkway.news/matvienko-is-surprised-that-russia-does-67053/)

[@mhikaric](https://twitter.com/mhikaric) summarizes the three main articles on decolonization that came out over the past few weeks eloquently and boils it down to the following conclusions.

However, Russia cannot be decolonized without the dissolution of the Federation. Decentralization of power in the country is key to democratization. However, no matter how the Federation is restructured, be it a Parliamentary Confederation or a loose Union akin to the EU...

...there will always be forces pressuring for power consolidation in Moscow. Without power consolidation restructured Russia cannot remain in its present territorial form. [Comparative Federalism and Decentralization: On Meaning and Measurement on JSTOR](https://bit.ly/3Q5qJJJ)

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia was in its most decentralized state in the past century (ignoring the Civil War). As consequence, it was not only Chechnya who declared sovereignty but also Tatarstan and others.

Such decentralization also coincided with democracy existing in Russia. Only for *two* years, until “liberal” Yeltsin ended it in the 1993 Constitutional Crisis. [Russian constitutional crisis of 1993](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/r/Russian_constitutional_crisis_of_1993.htm)

His successor continued the policy of power consolidation in the Kremlin and abolished gubernatorial elections in 2004. The elections were reinstated in 2012. The gap was used to clear up the local ranks and expand United Russia’s grip on power. [Russia: Putin Signs Bill Eliminating Direct Elections Of Governors](https://www.rferl.org/a/1056377.html)

Now regional governors go through phony elections or are simply appointed by Moscow. Regions and other regional entities (autonomous republics etc.) are treated as nothing more than colonies of Moscow in the political structure. [Putin Appoints Acting Governors Of Five Regions After Predecessors Resigned](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-putin-appoints-acting-governors-regions/31844671.html)

In the current roster of regional heads, 64 are from United Russia, 14 are independents, and the rest are from the pseudo-opposition parties. The independents should not mislead you: they are either from the syloviki/career bureaucrat class or have sworn allegiance to the Kremlin

So a scenario similar to the American Revolution (taxation without representation) or the Latin American decolonization (decline of the metropole and rise of the local elites) is unlikely in Russia. I suspect it'll be something new that is very hard to predict.

On the one hand, we have the classical economic domination over the colonies by the imperial heartland. Be it the Federal subjects or the EAEU members. On other hand, we have a unique situation of ethnic exceptionalism that is shared in the colonies dominated by ethnic Russians.

I already discussed the causes of Russophobia as a response to ethnic Russian exceptionalism driving their colonial ambitions. [twitter.com/MuKappa/status…](https://twitter.com/MuKappa/status/1531561246968905728?s=20&t=-eqmNljh2g3sb9fAdnSKKA)

Last time I did not discuss any numbers. Let's rectify that. Ethnic Russian exceptionalism has been on the rise since the 1990s. There are many factors driving it including revanchism, propaganda, education promoting the image of a benevolent empire, etc. [Великодержавные настроения в России достигли исторического максимума](https://www.levada.ru/2017/12/21/velikoderzhavnye-nastroeniya-v-rossii-dostigli-istoricheskogo-maksimuma/)

Levada conducted another survey in 2020. The respondents were asked if they considered Russia a "velikaya derzhava." Simply translated it means "great country," but derzhava stands for more than that: it is an archaic word for power, authority, and state, it has an imperial tone.

| [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUqJlFbWYAEgJk9.png)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUqJlFbWYAEgJk9.png) |

The surveys are conducted by Levada across Russia. However, we are not given any regional insights. I suspect that the mood is shared in regions that are dominated by ethnic Russians.

And this presents a problem - how does one democratize the current territories of the Russian Federation when there are such strong jingoist and ethnic exceptionalism sentiments that might drive recentralization of power to Moscow? Economic incentives and collective guilt.

I will discuss both economic incentives and the concept of collective guilt as tools for decolonization in a separate thread. But for now, I leave you with a list of the top 10 Russian exports in 2021.
