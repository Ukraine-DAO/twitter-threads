And naturally, the colonies are taxed appropriately by the metropole:

Tax revenues overall going into the federal budget are also dominated by the colonies, if the metropole, Moscow, and the old metropole, St. Petersburg, are excluded. Almost 80% of all tax revenues is coming from the colonies. [Аналитики назвали регионы с самыми высокими налоговыми сборами](https://delovoymir.biz/analitiki-nazvali-regiony-s-samymi-vysokimi-nalogovymi-sborami.html)

At least a third of the Russian Federal budget is coming from hydrocarbons (the upper estimate is 51%). This is troubling... for Moscow.
[Треть доходов бюджетной системы России оказалась связана с нефтью и газом](https://www.rbc.ru/economics/22/08/2019/5d555e4b9a7947aed7a185de)

These revenues from hydrocarbons cannot be coming forever. As the existing deposits deplete, extracting oil and gas from unexploited reserves is simply too costly. NB: this is yet another reason why the Russians started to look for new colonial possessions

Alright, so we've established the colonies, regions of the federation, are being exploited for their resources. But do they get anything in return? Not really, look at the population distribution of the empire. What of industrialization? Let's look at more maps:

Unsurprisingly, both Moscow and St. Petersburg areas are heavily industrialized. What's happening in and around Ufa and Surgut? Ufa and the neighboring cities are dominated by oil and gas and mining-related industries. To save on logistics some upstream factories are not far too.

Surgut and the rough area on other hand are purely extractive. The region produces 42% of all Russian oil and AO Surgutneftegaz is the largest enterprise. All other industries are tied into the oil and gas sector (logistics, etc.).

Another good example is how the Russian shipbuilding industry is spread out. Here you can see that the colonies are not trusted with this industry of high strategic value.

What of the overall level of industrialization of the federation? Russia is industrialized, relatively, even more so than some of the western countries as the map below shows - manufacturing value added as % of GDP, share of GDP contributed by the manufacturign sector.

There is a caveat. As the Chatham House says: Russian "manufacturing is not competitive on global markets" and is destined for domestic use. It is part of Russia's industrial sovereignty policy. The technological gap between Russia and the West is not new: [Technology and Soviet Foreign Trade: On the Political Economy of an Underdeveloped Superpower on JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2600488?seq=1)

That's why western sanctions hurt the Russian economy so much. Everything from mining to the very top of the production chain suffers - it is a colonial empire merely focused on colonial exploitation. A full embargo would break the empire.
[The illusion of Russia’s economic stabilization](https://www.politico.eu/article/the-illusion-of-russia-economic-stabilization-sanctions-war-ukraine/)

The colonies on the other hand stand to win quite a bit financially, with sufficient foreign investment (and other conditions). If for some reason a colony gains sovereignty it'll gain political agency *and* financial profits. The economic truth is being hidden.

The Kremlin/Moscow continues a decades-long narrative of "a benevolent metropole." For example, this article from Feb. 2021 highlights that in 2020 distributions from the federal center to the regions were record high:
[iz.ru/1126723/iuliia…](https://iz.ru/1126723/iuliia-tcerekh-dmitrii-grinkevich/vse-rublem-finansovaia-podderzhka-regionov-postavila-istoricheskii-rekord)

Or this article from 2017, outlining how Moscow, St. Petersburg, "hydrocarbon" regions, and Tatarstan "feed" the rest of the country: [Кто платит, а кто тратит: кормящие страну автономные округа, триллионы](https://realnoevremya.ru/articles/67340-reyting-regionov-rossii-po-nalogovym-otchisleniyam)

My thinking of Moscow being a classical imperial metropole is also supported by the Russians. Viktor Suslov, a Russian economics professor and member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, voiced some concerns about the imbalance in the federal economy. [kommersant.ru/doc/4154938](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/4154938)

In his interview with Kommersant, he said: “The worst “parasite” on Russia’s body is the Central Federal District [Moscow]. Its “contributions” to the target indicators of all federal districts appear to be negative, and at that, the “result” of its “interaction” with the Northwestern district is a reduction in the target indicators of the latter by almost a quarter.”

He adds: "The current situation is a consequence of disproportionate and unfairly high revenues, that are primarily received by Moscow. Financial resources are artificially drawn into the federal center from the entire country."

| [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FVGIGq8XoAEYcTH.jpg)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FVGIGq8XoAEYcTH.jpg) |

In his 2019 interview, however, Suslov doesn't predict that the federation would dissolve for economic reasons. He postulates that "the cultural and historical foundations of Russia's unity" are too strong.

Note, that he was on the same research team that found no economic reasons for the Soviet Union's collapse. [Суслов Виктор Иванович | Официальный портал ИЭОПП СО РАН](https://www.ieie.su/persons/suslov-vi.html)

This brings us to the ethnic minorities and their republics point. I disagree with Suslov's last point. The autonomous republics point is very obvious and has nothing to do with economics, that's why this is the only time I'll bring them up. They are obvious colonies.

So to sum up:
- Moscow and St. Petersburg are imperial centers
- Regions are exploited for their resources as colonies
- Decolonization would be a financial win for the colonies
- Decolonization must start with the dissolution of the federation, colonies are too lucrative

Colonies are too lucrative to grant them agency. The imperial centers stand to lose too much in a real federalization of the empire and even a liberal parliamentary government wouldn't risk upsetting the Muscovites.

In part 3 on the fate of Russia, I will discuss collective guilt as part of the decolonization process. For now, it is worth noting that trust in institutions in Russia is extremely low. The results are corroborated by  research: [Institutional Trust in Contemporary Moscow on JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27752301?seq=1)
[Russians Lead the World in Lack of Institutional Trust – Survey](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/01/22/russians-lead-world-lack-institutional-trust-a64235)

Social trust (trust in a stranger to do no harm) is also low in RU. Dupont and Karpoff posit that trust is formed by a triad of laws, reputation, and culture. With the dissolution of the empire, proper laws granting agency to the people can be introduced. 
[link.springer.com/article/10.100…](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-019-04229-1)

However, reputation and culture will have a long road ahead where the construct of collective guilt will play a critical role. 
End of thread.
