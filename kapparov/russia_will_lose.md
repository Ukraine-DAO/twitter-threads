The russians will lose this war, but I do not think it is a matter of months. 

In an earlier thread I mentioned a time horizon of 2-5 years. Here is why I think the war will last so long:

    So how will the current war end?<br />

    In Ukraine&#39;s victory.<br />
    <br />
    Would it push russia towards true democratic reforms and stop it from being a colonial aggressor? No.<br />

    What does the path to victory look like? 1/ https://t.co/QvKbxHNUb9<br />

1. The capacity to suffer of the russian people should not be underestimated. It is in their culture.

2. This year's RU federal budget deficit is estimated to be 0.9% of the GDP or 1.3 trillion RUB (~$22B at the current *official* exchange rate). Double it to get closer to the real number.

We only know that ~$285B in foreign currency reserves are frozen for sure. It is likely the rest of the reserves of ~$265B are liquid, meaning the RU economy can last ~6 years under the current sanctions.

USD and EUR trading are likely to be suspended soon in russia, with CNY becoming the primary foreign currency. This along with the centralization of production planning suggest that russia is aiming to become a command economy.

3. russian MIC factories are working overtime in three shifts. They have been since at least mid-summer.

RU energy consumption reports line up with the increase in mil output considering that the civilian sector shrank. For the first 7 months of 2022 energy cons. is up 2.2% and 2.7% in the Urals and Southern districts, primary locations of mil factories.

4. RU is unlikely to have equipment shortages in the short run. It'll be old and coming out of storage in poor condition. It largely depends on how RU maintenance takes care of it.

5. Mobilization will continue. The current regime does not care how many casualties are taken. It increasingly starts to seem to me that mobilization will continue indefinitely until either the russian population starts to exhibit unrest or they run out of men.

6. The russians are trying to crack down on corruption in the military and MIC. Recently they sacked the deputy minister of defense and head of logistics four-star general Bulgakov. [english.nv.ua: Putin fires army logistics chief](https://english.nv.ua/nation/putin-replaces-army-logistics-chief-russia-military-news-50272301.html)

The state duma defense committee is also requesting the prosecutor-general to inspect military logistics. [www.rbc.ru: Главы комитетов Госдумы попросили прокурора разобраться в снабжении](https://www.rbc.ru/politics/06/10/2022/633e7d119a7947524e6ab5bf)

7. Western delivery schedules suggest a long war. For instance, the 18 HIMARS systems recently hyped to be delivered to Ukraine will only arrive in ~2 years. Ukrainian pilots are also undergoing training for A-10s. The delivery date is unclear.

8. The Crimea effect might rally RU popular support for the war. Crimea is part of the RU imperial mythology. When the AFU starts operations to retake the peninsula even the most apathetic russians might become zealous ethnofascists.

    The imperial obsession of russians over Crimea is well reflected in putin&#39;s and the government&#39;s approval ratings hike following the annexation (s: Levada).<br />

9. The war won't end with the full liberation of all Ukrainian territories, including Crimea. It'll only end when the current regime falls in a coup. Right now I am not observing any major schisms among the RU ruling elites.

Though Prigozhin is making some moves, they are largely jabs at the RU MOD. His Wagner Group has been at odds with the MOD for years. Kadyrov's proclamations are likely simply what he *thinks* the tsar wants to hear. He is a self-proclaimed "putin's footman."

THE END

P.S. I earlier explained why we should expect a coup and not a revolution in russia: [twitter.com/MuKappa/status…](https://twitter.com/MuKappa/status/1576604181418631168?s=20&t=5mzoF9dCy8TMfMGuU376fA)

    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    There will be no &#34;popular uprising&#34; in russia.<br />
    <br />
    If hundreds of thousands of mobilized russians perish and the russian economy continues to degrade, there are likely to be protests but no revolution aimed at democratic reforms. <br />
