Russian language as a political weapon (ongoing üßµ)

It is no secret that any language could be weaponized and used as a political tool. That's how propaganda works. However, some Russian linguistic intricacies cannot be fully translated into English with the meaning preserved.

Russian (—Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏—è–Ω–∏–Ω) vs. Russian (—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π)

Both "—Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏—è–Ω–∏–Ω" and "—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π" are translated into English as "Russian." However, the two are not the same. "—Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏—è–Ω–∏–Ω" is someone who is from Russia or holds Russian citizenship. However, such a person is not necessarily "—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π."

"—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π" is anyone of Russian ethnicity. Such a person could be, say, from Ukraine. Such a person is most likely going to be a Russian speaker too. Things get more interesting when the two adjectives are applied to inanimate objects.

"–†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π" is something coming from Russia or made by Russia. "–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π" is something made by ethnic Russians from Russia. That's why the Russian Warship meme is so important. The crew of Moskva referred to themselves as "—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ—Ä–∞–±–ª—å." It was not just a warship.

It was a Russian warship made by ethnic Russians. This lines up with the ethnocentric policy that was promoted by the Russian government over the past decades. üá∑üá∫ is a multiethnic state but everyone is required to learn Russian. [@kamilkazani](https://twitter.com/kamilkazani) has a great thread on minorities in üá∑üá∫

Here it is: [bit.ly/3MoJ2XM](https://bit.ly/3MoJ2XM) That's why for a Russian speaker it is always surprising to hear a Russian citizen be called "—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π," i.e. not just Russian but also an ethnic Russian. It is not always the case. Every fifth citizen of üá∑üá∫ is not an ethnic Russian.

That's is why a slogan that is frequently chanted by some attendees of political rallies (not protests) in üá∑üá∫ "–†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è –¥–ª—è —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏—Ö" that translates as "Russia for Russians" might seem harmless to some Western observers.

However, such a slogan has an extreme far-right meaning: "Russia for *ethnic* Russians." By the way, [@navalny](https://twitter.com/navalny) was spotted at such rallies back in 2011. Maybe he has changed, maybe not. The black/yellow/white is an old Russian Imperial flag used by the Russian far right groups.

So to wrap up on Russian vs. Russian. The delineation between "—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π" and "—Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏—è–Ω–∏–Ω" is crucial and frequently lost in translations. Russia's ethnocentric policymakers probably love that the two are the same in English. The two are not the same due to Russia's imperial past.

And now the those in power in Russia are trying the blur the line between "—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π" and "—Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏—è–Ω–∏–Ω." "—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π," an ethnic Russian, could be someone born and living abroad, specifically in one of the neighboring countries.

When the lines are blurred, the Kremlin can claim that an ethnic Russian born and living abroad needs to be "protected" by Russia on the same level as a citizen of the Russian Federation. Such rhetoric has been used by the Russian authorities to motivate their imperial ambitions.

–ù–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç (Nationalist) vs. –ù–∞—Ü–∏—Å—Ç (Nazi)

Whoa, aren't those obviously not the same? Well, they are the same, according to the current Russian propaganda. Since 2014 the Russian state and affiliated media have been working hard on blurring the line between the two.

The above is an example of an article from 2019 that equates the two constructs, titled "How the Ukrainian Nationalism and Nazism formed." After all, the two words in the Russian language have the same root "–Ω–∞—Ü."

There is also a critical difference between nationality and its Russian translation, "–Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å." Generally, nationality indicates one's citizenship if you are from the West. But "–Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å" has nothing to do with citizenship, it is first and foremost ethnicity.

Funnily enough in the Soviet era and early post-Soviet Russia ethnicity used to be indicated in the passports. The "tradition" remained in many other ex-Soviet states maintaining the "nationality" divide in otherwise unitary states.

Such a divide accompanied by the Russian propaganda abroad in the neighboring states formed a potent combination.

If someone in Russia's neighboring state decided to protest and wave their national flag, then they are nationalists, they could be nazis too, ergo "—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ" or ethnic Russians there need Russia's protection. Nationality is weaponized to foment ethnic tensions when there are none

There are many videos on Youtube where [@VolodymyrZolkin](https://twitter.com/VolodymyrZolkin), a Ukrainian journalist, interviewed over a 100 Russian POWs. Many times he had to explain the differences between nationalists and nazis to the POWs. To them, the two constructs are the same. Ignorance or propaganda? Idk.

However, it is not something new that post-Soviet Russia invented. In the Soviet times, anyone speaking their native non-Russian language and overhead by a Russian was most likely going to be accused of "nationalism," per first-hand accounts from my friends and relatives in üá∞üáø

–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –º–∏—Ä - Russkyi Mir

A colonial term of the old that reemerged in the 1990s and is extensively used by Putin's regime.

    This construct is quite loaded and does not have an exact translation. The most common translation is the &#34;Russian world.&#34; However, it could also be translated as¬†&#34;Russian peace,&#34; akin to pax russica. https://t.co/VIvrXWKmmQ<br />
