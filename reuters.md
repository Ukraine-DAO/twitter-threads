1/ ‚ö°Ô∏èPreparing a material about the largest russian propaganda news agency - @Reuters 

I have substantial amount of evidence but will be grateful for additional info üíÖ 

Please share the truth about who they are with others instead of their üá∑üá∫ propaganda. https://t.co/w1ZBrVikfq

2/ I was wondering if they would stop spreading #russianLies about Ukraine after the genocidal invasion started. Not even that stopped them. 

Here&#39;s one of my favourite examples of @Reuters &#34;journalism&#34; üëè https://t.co/sdizdWWzSm

3/ This is what @Reuters had the audacity to publish when Azov&#39;s heroes who showed superhuman courage and resilience while defending Mariupol in inhumane conditions ended up in ruscists hands.

Btw, @New_Narrative, that article should be titled &#34;Nonsense about Azov Regiment&#34;. https://t.co/uQ8j6qtsAr

4/ I collect accurate info about Azov Regiment in @Ukraine_DAO Notion. #Íë≠  
@Reuters you guys should check it out since Azov is your favourite thing to talk about üíû https://t.co/ZHV4z4hd6p

5/ This is @reuters take on Medvedchuk. Here&#39;s a little info on who he is:

6/ Huge thank you to @mhmck for stating the obvious. I&#39;m amazed by how many people are not aware of @Reuters being a rascist propaganda platform even though all the evidence is right there, in plain sight. https://t.co/Lsu6mzAM20

14/  I was told the other day that @Reuters is the most reliable news agency according to some studies. If that&#39;s the most reliable one, we are screwed. https://t.co/cDRs9IWjdG

15/ I&#39;m patiently waiting for @felix_light to explain to us this nonsense he wrote for @Reuters. Felix, check your DMs. I&#39;m in the UK too so if you need medical attention please let me know, I&#39;ll organise. https://t.co/HQl5QRk6RZ https://t.co/NnF3d1sBSK

16/ The @politico article I just mentioned in WR. @Reuters 
https://t.co/x2LLErA8yf

17/ I am aware of this statement they made,  but unless 
@reuters
 stops to spread russian propaganda there&#39;s no reason to consider Reuters aren&#39;t compromised anymore. 

Their continued spread of lies is testimony to that.

18/ Let&#39;s make @reuters memes! @felix_light https://t.co/tSaHHg6Ipq

19/ Attaching this useful diagram for @reuters journalists who struggle to make sense of what ruscists are saying. @felix_light, you are welcome. https://t.co/3DuqB9f4W2

20/ https://t.co/vAsPxHoQFq

21/ @Reuters guys, your license should be &#34;exported&#34; for publishing this. Disgrace. 

 @Ofcom 

https://t.co/qRUmAdGD1J

22/ As @saver_ag highlighted, @Reuters misspelled  &#34;russian invasion&#34; which is very unfortunate. russia is only mentioned in passing for some reason.
Also, there is no &#34;crisis&#34;. Crisis is what @reuters are having - integrity crisis.

37/  @ghostofkebab I am Ukrainian and Kherson is not a pro-r*ssian region. We don&#39;t have any pro-r*ssian regions because no one wants to live like russians.

41/  Dear @AFP, @reuters etc - there are no &#34;separatists&#34; in Ukraine, repeating again: https://t.co/kKwzzHg2zD

 These are terrorists &#34;imported&#34; to Ukraine from russia, not sure what @reuters journalists were doing in the car with them.

https://t.co/3ApyqXyFW3

42/ Meanwhile @reuters continues to legitimise a genocidal country looting Ukrainian grain.

This is some the lowest I&#39;ve seen &#34;journalists&#34; go and I&#39;ve watched RU propaganda for years. 

@tuvangumrukcu @Orhan__Coskun are you proud of yourselves?

43/ @tuvangumrukcu @Orhan__Coskun  - brought you guys some useful materials you can use for your reference next time you write about russia. You are welcome.
