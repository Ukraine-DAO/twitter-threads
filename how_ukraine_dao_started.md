“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world: indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.”

Trying to process this tonight. 

The Telegram chat that turned into [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) was set up on 21 Feb - 3 days before the genocidal invasion 💔

    - What is the largest donation to @BackAndAlive?<br />
    - Probably $4m in crypto from @Ukraine_DAO. I don&#39;t remember others, tbh. There are some companies that frequently give smaller amounts, so their total amount may be larger.  But as a one-off, it&#39;s this one.<br />

It was just [@zencephalon](https://twitter.com/zencephalon), [@DefiHope](https://twitter.com/DefiHope) and me in the beginning. 

[@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) remains a product of love for 🇺🇦 & conviction that it has agency and the right to defend itself from unprovoked russian aggression. 

We help to make that [#russiaNGMI](https://twitter.com/hashtag/russiaNGMI) [pic.twitter.com/4i3AKWcF9s](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1525283712019091461/photo/1)

[@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) broke the perception of NFTs as just silly cartoon images, to show how they can solve real life problems. 

✨ At some point, contributions were being received at an average rate of $1000 per minute, along with a 500 ETH donation from [@OnlyFans](https://twitter.com/OnlyFans)

    🚀 It is the tenth most expensive NFT ever sold. <br />
    <br />
    🇺🇦 Proceeds were donated to @BackAndAlive, @Ukraine, @OutRightIntl &amp; other Ukrainian charities. <br />

We organized both online and offline to serve [@Ukraine](https://twitter.com/Ukraine) and show how charity, war relief and evacuation efforts can be organized through DAOs - decentralized autonomous organizations.

[@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) Trucks went into an actual warzone to deliver food to civilians in the Kharkiv region. This has literally never been done before by a DAO.

The trucks are partially powered by ETH donations - huge thank you to [@kmets_](https://twitter.com/kmets_) for being their big supporter ❤️ [pic.twitter.com/GXefO3f2QW](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1525287162882756613/photo/1)

    I couldn&#39;t speak about this before for safety reasons but a @Ukraine_DAO truck and its driver Oleksandr made a heroic decision to deliver food to the Kharkiv region a few days ago. A nerve wrecking few days for us but he made it out! 💙💛 https://t.co/mmcERnpTcR<br />

[@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) is now supported by [@mintsyfra](https://twitter.com/mintsyfra) of [@Ukraine](https://twitter.com/Ukraine) - first DAO in the world to have support at a state level.

It's a huge privilege for all of us to be able to help Ukraine, and also its defenders - through [@BackAndAlive](https://twitter.com/BackAndAlive).

Forever grateful for all the love we get - not sure where I would be right now without the mentorship & support 8of [@BlockGeekDima](https://twitter.com/BlockGeekDima). He gave me the most valuable advice at some point - to remain authentic, just the way I am. Very happy I have followed this advice so far.

[@VitalikButerin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin) is an actual legend too. He found the time and empathy to call me on day 1, to really hear me, and to show unapologetic support even if it was going to piss off a million people. 

Super grateful to each and every kind human supporting us ❤️

Also want to say a very big thank you to this actual queen - [@drosewritings](https://twitter.com/drosewritings) ✨

🌱 Her excellent article "What Can DAOs Learn from Holacracy?" (shared with us by [@dimka_eth](https://twitter.com/dimka_eth)) had a huge impact on [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) development:

    - 2 months ago<br />
    - do you realise that most DAOs are still not at this level of development, after years of trying?&#34;<br />

    🇺🇦 @Ukraine_DAO is only getting started 🌱 <br />

But the real heroes in this story are the Ukrainian people. Their unity and a sense of dignity still amaze me every day. 

Each and every Ukrainian had to become a fighter - different frontlines for each of us. 

We are under attack from every front. 

But we are together ❤️ [pic.twitter.com/nWywtcQvib](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1525295824808382464/photo/1)

"Real empowerment requires boundaries and clear expectations via common law or governance." [@drosewritings](https://twitter.com/drosewritings) 

Ukraine right now is really amazing; it’s operating as an offline DAO. 

Everyone is doing whatever they can towards the same mission. 

That's what a DAO is 🇺🇦

    Ukrainian political culture is bottom-up and very decentralized. It starts from a community, which Ukrainians call “hromada”. Hromada – a key word for Ukrainian political philosophy since at least 19th century, f.e. philosophy of Mykhaylo Drahomanov 1/8<br />

Our curent focus at [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) is to help [#ArmUkraineNow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArmUkraineNow) + counter russian propaganda. 

The reason for that is because that's what Ukraine needs the most and we work around the clock to provide support and stop [#russianLies](https://twitter.com/hashtag/russianLies). 

I share more about how we work in this  AMA:
