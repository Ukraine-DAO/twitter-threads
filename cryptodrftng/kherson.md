As promissed a 🧵 on what was happening inside [#Kherson](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Kherson) city yesterday (22-7). I have been in contact some local sources who painted a picture of every growing chaos  & fear among 🇷🇺 troops & collaborators inside the city. First it's important to know that during the occupation

The 🇷🇺 invaders have been setting a system of checkpoints on almost any intersection in the city, these are called blockposts by the civilians. Before last week these checkpoints where mostly manned by [#Rosgvardiya](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rosgvardiya) troops which are a internal mil. force directly under [#Putin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Putin).

During the last few days,most of these [#Rosvguardia](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rosvguardia) seem to have left the city and manning of the checkpoint seemed more lacks. This seems to have increased the number of desertions,farmers in the surrounding areas are being confronted with 🇷🇺 soldiers dressed in civilian clothes

Asking for a lift & directions towards [#Crimea](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Crimea). Yesterday however these checkpoints seem te be manned by regular soldiers & all [#Rosgvardiya](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rosgvardiya) seemed to have disappeared. These regular troops(?) Seem less organised and more paranoid checking everybody's id (even young childrens)

there have also been random searches of houses, appartments & garages. There is a deep fear for [#Partisans](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Partisans) and collaborators which are very active. everyday there are shootings directed at 🇷🇺 forces. Yesterday they started going door to door in the [#Dniprovskiy](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dniprovskiy) district which is

the more expensive area in [#Kherson](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Kherson), and started looting luxury goods from houses. The constant bombing of the area just outside of town seem to have a very big impact on both collaborators and occupying forces. Yesterday around 13.00 there was a very large explosion in the north

just behind the bus station. houses even at more then 2 km away were shaking. Thats my update for now i will keep in touch with my sources to keep you updated if there are any major developments!
