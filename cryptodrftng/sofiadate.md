Someone just sent me this and I want to throw up. They say they get targeted ads like this every day.  

[@date_sofia](https://twitter.com/date_sofia), are you guys alright over there? 

P.S. You got the hair colour wrong, that's not what Ukrainian women look like. Assholes.

Since we are on this topic, sharing an example of a fragile male ego hurting from encoutering a woman who is better educated on the subject than him - humbling experience for many Western men. 

Don't be like Peter, donate to [www.comebackalive.in.ua: Donate | comebackalive](https://www.comebackalive.in.ua/donate) & listen to Ukrainians.

    @cryptodrftng @sftanya @ZelenskyyUa @OlafScholz If I‚Äôd be really angry person, I would answer to your primitive tweet saying ‚Äúsome say, that the only good thing that came from Ukraine to the west that‚Äôs  prostitutes‚Äù. But I‚Äôm not angry. So I‚Äôm not going to say that. Or I‚Äôm going to say that to you, exclusively.<br />

I seriously can't believe people can be so horrible. Any information on who runs [@date_sofia](https://twitter.com/date_sofia) will be much appreciated - I don't have time to research it myself.

    Literally have seen this exact ad before as well. Not only that, but the constant jokes about taking advantage of Ukrainian women escaping rape, torture, and death isn‚Äôt funny whatsoever, it‚Äôs just pure evil https://t.co/8LsubX0a70<br />
