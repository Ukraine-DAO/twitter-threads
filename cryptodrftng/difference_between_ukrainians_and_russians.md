Hey [@NewellJeffOne](https://twitter.com/NewellJeffOne) the way Ukrainians fight for each other is a topic for a separate 🧵 but here's a quick summary of what it means to be Ukrainian - perfect description of why svynosobaky fucked with the wrong country 👇

❗️When I say "Ukrainian" I don't mean citizenship

I can tell whether someone is Ukrainian or ruSSian very quickly:

A 🇺🇦 person has freedom & accountability as core values.

A 🇷🇺 person needs a tsar to bow down to. Nothing is ever their responsibility. They're pathetic.

    To clarify:<br />
    ✅Any person of 🇺🇦 origin, regardless of whether they have a 🇺🇦 passport or not, is Ukrainian, as long as they carry our cultural code<br />
    ✅@MindfulWebz for example is based in LA and is still learning 🇺🇦<br />
    ✅ Call her not Ukrainian enough and I&#39;ll bite your head off 🔥 https://t.co/5yiaAe00dB<br />
