# Conversation in Walter Report about Reuters

Author: [–ê–ª—å–æ–Ω–∞ –®–µ–≤—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng)  
*Links to this thread: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1531363976658964480), [PingThread](https://pingthread.com/thread/1531363976658964480), [ThreadReader](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1531363976658964480.html), [Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1531363976658964480)*

A few people have asked me what happened today, so I'd like to explain. There was a conversation happening in [@walter_report](https://twitter.com/walter_report) Twitter Spaces about [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters). 

Both me and [@gujingc](https://twitter.com/gujingc) started our comments from saying that we are aware that not all [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) journalists are corrupt.

However, [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) really needs to stop spreading russian propaganda, otherwise their license should be revoked by [@Ofcom](https://twitter.com/Ofcom) and they shouldn't be broadcasting because their spread of lies has very serious consequences in Ukraine right now. We are being killed because of it.

One of the gentlemen in the spaces got hella triggered and started shouting at me. I was told that my attitude stinks, that it shouldn't matter that I'm from Ukraine and all sorts of other inappropriate, tonedeaf things were said.

After he finished, I said that it's completely unacceptable to not be able to control yourself like that in the presence of Ukrainian people who are going through a genocide and that if I manage to maintain composure then he should be able too.

Grateful for everyone's messages, have to go on a call so will reply later. Just for the record - it does matter that I am Ukrainian. Ukrainians should not be shouted at. 

[@NovelSci](https://twitter.com/NovelSci) wrote a great üßµ on how to treat angry, emotional Ukrainians:

    I‚Äôll say it again. If you see someone experiencing horrific trauma, that is not the time to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù how they feel about their attacker. Give them space; let them be angry. They have reason to be. Let others have nuanced convos and debate, but don‚Äôt demand it of them right now. https://t.co/Z62D8InyeT<br />

You can familiarise yourself with some examples of [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) spreading russian propaganda in this üßµ. Sending love to everyone, have a great evening üíôüíõ

I've been asked to name the gentleman - it was [@OSINT88](https://twitter.com/OSINT88). I said it in Twitter Spaces but probably worth reiterating - your hurt feelings are not comparable to the suffering of Ukrainian people. Get a grip.

[@OSINT88](https://twitter.com/OSINT88), batshit conspiracy theories are going strong these days, not gonna lie. [twitter.com/osint88/status‚Ä¶](https://twitter.com/osint88/status/1531332145251332097?s=21&t=yoT3FGhKN_fVoUATzDbL2Q)

[@OSINT88](https://twitter.com/OSINT88) FYI  The main source spreading "batshit conspiracy theories" about [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) - [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) itself:
