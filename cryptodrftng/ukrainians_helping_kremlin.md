Another beautiful example of how russians work: fragmentation. You take a "good russian" open all the doors for them using money, oligarchs, "great" russian culture, grants for spreading democracy and fighting corruption etc. And they start singing a song about bad Kremlin.

They tweet stupid things like this one "Ukrainians don't understand that they help Kremlin..." when Ukrainians don't agree to give them any kind of legacy or authority.

These type of FSB assets are very useful. Because they eventually steal support/time/resources from the only power that can help to create "democratic Russia" in any close future - Armed Forces of Ukraine.

There is no journalism in Russia. 
There is no opposition in Russia. 
They all want BIG Russia, new territories, everyone to speak/understand/pray on russian language, more money for themselves and ukrainians to feel guilty.

When we had tyrants in Ukraine - we didn't flee to fight them on YouTube. 

Don't waste time and money on russians who left russia to "fight putin" from Berlin/London/New York. Eventually they will always say Crimea is russia, ukrainians are our brothers "who don't understand".

And also they are so chauvinistic they can't even get what and why Ukrainians are telling them. The idea that someone in Ukraine can actually teach them smth not the other way around is just beyond their capacity to consume. 

That's it. Sorry not sorry. Russians are guilty. ALL.
