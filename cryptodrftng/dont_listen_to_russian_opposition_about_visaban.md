Ok let me help [@leonidragozin](https://twitter.com/leonidragozin) who’s a little bit confused 

❗️Not getting to sip latte in Riga is NOT a “human tragedy”, but [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) is

❗️”Emigre opposition” is part of russia’s “special cultural operation” aimed at spreading the “nOt aLL ruSSiAnS” narrative

    oh honey 😅 can someone tell this dude that this is not “putin’s russophobia narrative” — most of us genuinely despise your whining, colonial and entitled asses and would rather see you fixing your genocidal country than sipping lattes in riga and posting delusional tweets https://t.co/hOSCwSPL1Q<br />

Here’s what the “heroic” emigre opposition does after they are “rescued” from the russia state:

❗️They join 🇷🇺 in its efforts to erase Ukrainians from existence, including in the cultural sphere

This is the most idiotic situation I’ve seen in my whole life.

    So let me summarise 🧐<br />
    <br />
    ❗️russians who have never been held accountable for systemic oppression and genocides, invaded Ukraine and are committing another #GenocideOfUkrainians<br />
    <br />
    ⁉️But we need to make sure that they’re not treated unfairly if they don’t go on holiday to Paris? https://t.co/tUWYHuhRrw<br />

❗️If you believe that you can repeat the same action (or inaction) and get a completely different outcome as a result - you’re probably delusional. 

Get off Twitter and go see the doctor.

    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    ❗This is an extremely important point.<br />
    <br />
    ❗The reason why russians are committing genocide now with zero shame is because they got away with it last time.<br />
    <br />
    ❗People who silence us or shame Ukrainians for being angry should realise one simple thing - you are helping them kill us. https://t.co/W32HXMisMo<br />
