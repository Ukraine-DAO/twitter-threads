If anyone knows [@joerogan](https://twitter.com/joerogan), let him know that I'd love to speak on his podcast.
Saying that russian speakers in Ukraine  are pro-russia is a narrative fabricated by 🇷🇺 propaganda. 

I'm from 🇺🇦 and spoke russian there to my friends for years. Never met anyone who wanted to join 🇷🇺

    29/ I&#39;ve just been sent this video of @lexfridman speaking on @joerogan (one of my favourite podcasts, BTW) and I have a question - WTF is this nonsense?! <br />
    &#34;russian speakers are pro-🇷🇺, want to be closer to 🇷🇺&#34;<br />
    &#34;🇺🇦 is a divided country&#34;<br />
    Are you guys mad?!<br />
