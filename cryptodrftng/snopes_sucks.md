So let me make sure I got this right:

1) [@snopes](https://twitter.com/snopes) call themselves "fact-checkers" ? 

2) The author, Bethania Palma, is a "journalist"? 

Is that supposed to be correct?  [twitter.com/LvivNightingal…](https://twitter.com/LvivNightingale/status/1539843535662448641)

    Azov are our heroes and they play a crucial role in defending Ukraine against r*ssian genocidal invasion, which is the only reason r*ssua is so butthurt about them. https://t.co/HVbt4d5LDB https://t.co/IqfvuGFnbH<br />

    <br />
    @ChristopherJM has Ukrainian blood on his hands. <br />
    <br />
    He is personally responsible for creating a completely wrong perception of @Polk_Azov for the Western audience, describing them as &#34;Ukrainian Nazis&#34;.<br />
