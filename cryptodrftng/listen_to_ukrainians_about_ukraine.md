üßµ: Making sure your Ukraine coverage is Ukraine-centered. Rampant russian propaganda has planted false narratives for years and the West views russian aggression and Ukraine's prospects through its own subjective lens. The solution: consuming a range of Ukrainian content.

Ukrainian English-language independent media deliver breaking news, first-person narratives, and glimpses into Ukrainian life, culture, and history. They are experts on the Ukrainian context. 2/14

When Ukrainians are featured in Western mainstream publications, their contributions are top notch. Case in point: [@NikaMelkozerova](https://twitter.com/NikaMelkozerova)‚Äôs multiple excellent pieces in [@TheAtlantic](https://twitter.com/TheAtlantic) 3/14

    My latest for @TheAtlantic . I think there are two types of people in the world. There are those who cry after falling, and those who pick themselves up and laugh. We Ukrainians are the second type. We laugh in the face of danger.<br />

First-person accounts offer an experience near way of getting to know Ukrainian subjectivity. Each essay is a gift. The more of these you read, the more you will understand. One recent example is this piece by [@alina_polyakova](https://twitter.com/alina_polyakova) 6/14

English speakers have ample content created by Ukrainians available to them at their fingertips. If you find yourself gravitating toward Western publications & writers, remember, this is a choice. This thread is a sample platter, not an exhaustive list. Additions welcome.
