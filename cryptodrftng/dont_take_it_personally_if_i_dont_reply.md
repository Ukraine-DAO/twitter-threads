Absolutely swamped with work and messages today üò≠ Trying to set up processes that help [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) team to self-manage and automate repetitive tasks so that I can have some semblance of life again, I've barely left the house in the last 3 months and haven't had a day off.

I also have type 1 diabetes which also requires attention and care, I've been pretty much neglecting myself but it's not sustainable. 

Please don't take it personally if I don't respond/send a very short reply or don't get back to you about something immediately ü•≤

I'm extremely grateful for all the love and support and really wish I could reply properly to every message but right now it's not physically possible üíî Here are a few ways you can help us:
