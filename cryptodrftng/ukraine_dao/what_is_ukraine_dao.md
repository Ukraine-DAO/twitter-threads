Ok so I promised to write a üßµ about it. Grateful to all the community members kindly reaching out offering help, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to explain what [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) is and how it works.

    Any DAOs not using governance tokens but instead keeping decision-making close to roles/working groups, or only allocating governance tokens once a member has been with the DAO for a certain time period or level of contribution?<br />

First of all, what is a DAO? The abbreviation is usually defined as Decentralised Autonomous Organisation, which is a bit of a misnomer tbh. 

‚ú® In my view, a DAO is a community with a mission and usually a blockchain-based wallet.

[@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) is on a mission to save üá∫üá¶

Check out the embedded üßµ to learn about  our work and how Ukraine DAO (UKD) formed.

Btw, this is a great question - it was always called Ukraine DAO. 

üïäÔ∏è I was a full time DAO contributor running operations and community management at [@FreeRossDAO](https://twitter.com/FreeRossDAO) prior to starting UKD with [@DefiHope](https://twitter.com/DefiHope) and [@zencephalon](https://twitter.com/zencephalon).

üá∫üá¶ Ukraine DAO is not tokenised like most other DAOs, which means there is no token that people can acquire to have voting power. We're managing perfectly well without it. The only authority is the Ukrainian people.

Sorry I got tired of this life today so will carry on later üòÇ

Grateful to [@WillPapper](https://twitter.com/WillPapper) from [@SyndicateDAO](https://twitter.com/SyndicateDAO) for jumping on the call with me about my discovery the same day üòÇ I'd been getting a bit upset because I sent it to a few friends and they couldn't understand what's so amazing. Also thank you to [@serjtys](https://twitter.com/serjtys) for sending me that üßµ

    @zach__davidson Ukraine DAO contributor @serjtys showed me this amazing üßµ by @WillPapper. Pretty much everything described in it had emerged in @Ukraine_DAO organically, which I find fascinating<br />
