🚨 Well, hello, freak bitches!

I was suspended by Twitter again for complaining about [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) - apologies, will definitely happen again!

Starting a 🧵 for a rundown of the things I wanted to say while I couldn't talk

The recording of my presentation for [@eth_barcelona](https://twitter.com/eth_barcelona) is out too 👇

❤️‍🩹My favourite part of it was when I looked at the title, realized that what I wrote made no sense because I was too sleed deprived when I made the slides and pretended it was meant to be like that 😹

I am also currently in 🇺🇦

❗️If you thought I hated svynosobaky before, wait until I'm back to 🇬🇧 - I have some shit to say.

❗️TLDR: if people saw what a gorgeous country ruscists came to destroy, virtually everyone in their sound mind would hate them with a burning passion.

💓 I am in Ukraine thanks to [@Uk4Ua](https://twitter.com/Uk4Ua) - I strongly recommend to everyone to support them either by spreading the word or donating to them.

❗️They deserve donations at least due to the fact that their Shaun Hopkins put up with my singing for 3 long days.

    ✨We are very grateful to Shaun Hopkins of @Uk4Ua for selflessly working day and night to deliver medical supplies to 🇺🇦... <br />

Last day of our journey to 🇺🇦 [@Uk4Ua](https://twitter.com/Uk4Ua) & I were accompanied by [@CroweDM](https://twitter.com/CroweDM) - Chief Political Correspondent of [@theage](https://twitter.com/theage) & [@smh](https://twitter.com/smh) 

"- Alright guys, what happens in this van, stays in this van.
- Unless it's tweeted out.
- That's correct."

The more time I spend in 🇺🇦, the more I despise the people who shamed me for not being here - none of them were Ukrainian

BREAKING NEWS: A 🇺🇦 person can live wherever the fuck they want and they don't have to explain themselves for it.

❗️I didn't go to my house because ruscists are using the biggest nuclear power plant in the world as a shield for their artillery positions

❗️They shell the place where I grew up from Grads. Let that sink in.

I still feel much better in 🇺🇦 than in 🇬🇧

Because it's my home.

Last in this 🧵 for today, but not least - [#Nikopol](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nikopol) is getting shelled day and night.

I have family there. For the love of god, don't offer evacuation. I know everyone means well but trust me, I've thought of it and done what I could. 

Talking about it is just more pain.

🚨What DOES help is spreading the word about [#Nikopol](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nikopol) and the fact that [#russiaisaterroriststate](https://twitter.com/hashtag/russiaisaterroriststate) 

I realised this would start happening from when svynosobaky got hold of the Zaporizhzhia NPP

🚨Now it's happening. It's nuclear terrorism.
