⚡️Aaron's talk really resonated with me.

✨One of the most annoying things to me is when [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) is described purely as a fundraising DAO and no other work done by us is mentioned. 

💝 Quick rundown of the different types of work that we do - 🧵

    &#34;The actual value of a DAO is not created by its treasury, by how much money it&#39;s raised.<br />
    <br />
    What matters is the contribution that the DAO makes towards its mission - what it has done, the value it created.&#34;<br />

First of all, what is a DAO?🧐

✨The abbreviation is usually defined as Decentralised Autonomous Organisation, which is kinda a misnomer

✨ In my view, a DAO is a community with a mission & a blockchain-based wallet. 

✨ Its structure then should be adjusted to the mission.

    What DAOs do you know of that are coordinating a fleet of 30 trucks to provide humanitarian aid?<br />
    <br />
    This week on Campfire, @cryptodrftng shared how @Ukraine_DAO’s deeply personal coordination efforts go way beyond what typical charitable fundraising can accomplish. https://t.co/yLVLnUTInr<br />

[@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) does many  types of work to help defend 🇺🇦 against the genocidal 🇷🇺 invasion. 

✨We are an extremely agile impact DAO - able to adjust to Ukraine's changing needs faster than a normal charity ever could.

    1/ This is a great question, @WillManidis - a lot of people asked me this in the early days of @Ukraine_DAO <br />
    <br />
    ❓ Why create a DAO when you can donate directly? - 🧵<br />
    <br />
    ✨ This is what Ukraine DAO achieved since then that wouldn&#39;t have been possible without it: https://t.co/VRVr53PwOq<br />

[@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) working groups are NOT equally active - they're activated depending on what's needed.

💛 In terms of offline work, the busiest one is obviously Ukraine DAO Trucks - they're run by my parents & partially powered by Ethereum donations:
✨ completely separate from the main treasury - [ukraine-dao.notion.site: Ukraine DAO Trucks](https://ukraine-dao.notion.site/Ukraine-DAO-Trucks-8c0e44dc691c4d5f915ec42cf064b26e)
