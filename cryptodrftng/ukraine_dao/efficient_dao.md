✨EFFICIENT WORK CULTURE - [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) 🧵

⚡️Disclaimer: by no means am I claiming we are an examplary team 

✨What I do claim: we do get much more shit done for Ukraine in a day, with no ops budget, than [@ICRC](https://twitter.com/ICRC), [@UN](https://twitter.com/UN) and other assholes with huge budgets

    Would it be helpful if I wrote up how I see efficient work culture? We are improving onboarding at @Ukraine_DAO and I thought maybe it&#39;s actually better if I write this up publicly - would be easy to share with people who are considering joining us. Thoughts? 🧐 https://t.co/qVDX0yYoGn<br />

✅ TLDR: before criticising someone, make sure you've done your own fucking job

📚 Essential reading - THE ADVANTAGE BY PATRICK LENCIONI

✅ Recommended to me by [@BlockGeekDima](https://twitter.com/BlockGeekDima) 

✅ The book is not about DAOs. The book is about how to organise any group of people to get anything done



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

    Facts. In @Ukraine_DAO we have separate working groups for every workstream, otherwise not much would get done. Most groups have dedicated projects in @asana for task management. Here&#39;s helpful advice on it from &#34;The Advantage&#34; by Patrick Lencioni: https://t.co/2bk8FvkPPK https://t.co/AFfwIIxA6S<br />

No one has time for petty internal "politics" within [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) team
We are extremely picky about contibutors we onboard. 

The general policy is to onboard people we have already established a friendship with and we are sure they are aligned with us

    ✨Being a good culture fit is pretty much the only requirement for team members.<br />

    ❌ When values/goals are not aligned, there&#39;s going to be unnecessary tension - we don&#39;t have time for it. https://t.co/SYla8Umicn<br />

Here's a page describing our Mission and Values

The core principle [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) operates under:

❗ We are NOT "neutral". We take sides when we see people and countries being wronged. There is no virtue in being neutral in the face of evil

[www.notion.so: FunDAOmentals - Mission & Values](https://www.notion.so/ukraine-dao/FunDAOmentals-Mission-Values-54d3355f52f24354be085a970fbb9dd9)

⁉️ I also don't understand why in DAOs (decentralised autonomous organisations), decentralising for the sake of it is seen as something that's always positive

Example: We got a lot of backlash at first for donating over $4m to [@BackAndAlive](https://twitter.com/BackAndAlive) 



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    2/ I previously addressed this in our Discord. There are very few “civilians” in #Ukraine right now. Virtually each and every one of them has to become a warrior and fight for their lives. More than happy to speak about this more because I know the real situation there. https://t.co/tpGZinXR9R<br />

As you can see, someone has to take charge & to be accountable
Distribution of decision making is cool, but during genocide we don't give a fuck about where someone in the US thinks we should donate to, in order for them to feel good about themselves

Basically, what you want to have:

✅ minimal "politics" (as in, within the team)
✅ minimal confusion (point for improvement for us)
✅ high morale & productivity (can't complain re [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO)) 
✅ low contributor turnover (so far we only had 1 person leave 👇)

Most important point:

🌱 Conflict can be the engine of rejuvenation and creating better versions of ourselves.

❗️Conflict within the team is to be addressed heads on and NOT to be avoided at all costs

👏Constructive criticism is welcome

At the same time:

❓Don't like something? 

✅ Together with bringing up the problem, make sure to bring a suggested solution.

🚨Don't expect me or anyone else to make things better just because you noticed something isn't good enough

    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    2/ I&#39;m a very open person and I&#39;m pretty sure that I take in feedback and constructive criticism pretty well. A couple months ago I went for a walk with @serjtys who was considering joining @Ukraine_DAO and he said he was considering joining us but we were not transparent enough.<br />

❗️ If you can't collaborate in a Google Doc, there is no app/DAO tool that will save you 👇

    1/ 💯Same goes for &#34;complex DAO tools&#34; - let&#39;s not make them complex then? 😂 <br />
    <br />
    A lot of @Ukraine_DAO contributors have limited to no experience with Web3/crypto, we adjust the tools to them instead of trying to do it the other way around: https://t.co/8hU5QUtfFV https://t.co/TvHpLARFyJ<br />

This is an ongoing 🧵and I'll be adding stuff to it later

Other points:
✅ we don't have team meetings
✅ async-first communication unless otherwise agreed. That means people will reply to you when they can

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    3/ What I&#39;ve found is there&#39;s no approach/framework that can be applied to Ukraine DAO and not cause some issues so we pick and choose &#43; accept that we can&#39;t anticipate everything and some mistakes will be made along the way &#43; things will change and the DAO will change overtime.<br />

✅ if someone isn't replying, that's not that ignoring you - you aren't the centre of the Universe

🚨If it's urgent, message again, or message someonr else, or just call 

Hope this helps someone!

This is what all of the above applied in practice looks like - 🧵

Spoiler alert: it's a lot of fun 😹
