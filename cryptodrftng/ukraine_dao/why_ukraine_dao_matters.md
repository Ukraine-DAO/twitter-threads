This is a great question, [@WillManidis](https://twitter.com/WillManidis) - a lot of people asked me this in the early days of [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) 

❓ Why create a DAO when you can donate directly? - 🧵

✨ This is what Ukraine DAO achieved since then that wouldn't have been possible without it:

🔍 [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) is helping the Stanford-backed project called the Starling Lab document russian war crimes. 

This is going to be critical for making sure justice is served.

Ukraine DAO made the largest donation to support [@BackAndAlive](https://twitter.com/BackAndAlive) in its history

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    - What is the largest donation to @BackAndAlive?<br />
    - Probably $4m in crypto from @Ukraine_DAO. I don&#39;t remember others, tbh. There are some companies that frequently give smaller amounts, so their total amount may be larger.  But as a one-off, it&#39;s this one.<br />

✨UkraineDAO's NFT of the Ukrainian flag raised 2258 ETH for [#Ukraine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ukraine) ($6.75M)

🚀 It is the tenth most expensive NFT ever sold. 

🇺🇦 Proceeds were donated to [@BackAndAlive](https://twitter.com/BackAndAlive), [@Ukraine](https://twitter.com/Ukraine), [@OutRightIntl](https://twitter.com/OutRightIntl) & other Ukrainian charities.

    3/ @Ukraine_DAO broke the perception of NFTs as just silly cartoon images, to show how they can solve real life problems. <br />
    <br />
    ✨ At some point, contributions were being received at an average rate of $1000 per minute, along with a 500 ETH donation from @onlyfans <br />

🚚 Ukraine DAO Trucks partially powered by ETH donations (they have a separate wallet from the main treasury) & operated by my parents deliver humanitarian aid in Ukraine, including the warzone - [twitter.com/cryptodrftng/s…](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1529098085611319296?s=21&t=MS5rPsC25iccKKuL_-2hvg)

✨ We created a precedent for a DAO to not only co-exist with a state government peacefully but to help and support each other 🌱

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    6/ @Ukraine_DAO is now supported by @mintsyfra of @Ukraine - first DAO in the world to have support at a state level.<br />
    <br />
    It&#39;s a huge privilege for all of us to be able to help Ukraine, and also its defenders - through @BackAndAlive. <br />

Here's a detail about Ukraine DAO's development that I find very interesting - I never read Daemon and never heard of Daniel Suarez when building Ukraine DAO. Yet it developed pretty much exactly as described in that [@WillPapper](https://twitter.com/WillPapper) thread

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    @zach__davidson Ukraine DAO contributor @serjtys showed me this amazing 🧵 by @WillPapper. Pretty much everything described in it had emerged in @Ukraine_DAO organically, which I find fascinating<br />

Here's the 🧵 I'm talking about:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    Many people have a narrow definition of decentralization. They define &#34;decentralized&#34; as &#34;trustless on-chain governance&#34;.<br />
    <br />
    This framing may actually be less decentralized and autonomous than other DAO structures.<br />
    <br />
    Some different ways to think about decentralization 👇<br />
