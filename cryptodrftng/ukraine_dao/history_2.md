Just found this screenshot of [@ljxie](https://twitter.com/ljxie) tweet, she's a co-producer of [@EthereumFilm](https://twitter.com/EthereumFilm) 

I took the screenshot on 19 Feb and spent some time thinking.

A day later I posted this.

    1/ Looked through my camera roll from the weeks preceding the full scale invasion on 24th February. This was posted on my Insta stories on the 20th Feb. One day later, @Ukraine_DAO was born.  <br />

Another day later, I messaged my friend [@Mehdiaeth](https://twitter.com/Mehdiaeth) and asked to squat social media handles for [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO). 

Timing is critical in emergency situations.

When russians started the full-scale invasion, everything was already prepared for Ukraine DAO to help degend Ukraine.

    1/ Found the messages from 21 Feb in which I ask my friend @Mehdiaeth to squat the usernames for @Ukraine_DAO.<br />
    So strange to see this now, I must&#39;ve been under so much stress I can&#39;t remember how I sent these, and the cold/short tone is very reflective of my state at that time. https://t.co/WvyKG78bAa<br />

[@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) adapts to Ukraine's changing defence needs faster than any other form of organisation possibly could. 

It's a unique model that's still developing but I'm so happy I did it with the help of thousands of amazing people.

    Trying to process this tonight. <br />

    The Telegram chat that turned into @Ukraine_DAO was set up on 21 Feb - 3 days before the genocidal invasion üíî https://t.co/S6Uo909e9Y<br />

On day 1, [@VitalikButerin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin) called me and I spent an hour explaining to him what was about to happen 

[@ljxie](https://twitter.com/ljxie) reached out and [@EthereumFilm](https://twitter.com/EthereumFilm) crew dropped everything they were doing and flew to London to film the first days of [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) formation ‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    If someone told me a year ago that @EthereumFilm crew would fly from LA to film me, I&#39;d laugh. Really wishing we met under different circumstances and wishing there was no need for @Ukraine_DAO  but it was still  awesome to meet @zach__davidson &amp; team üá∫üá¶üíò<br />

The time between me seeing [@ljxie](https://twitter.com/ljxie) tweet, thinking of [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) and then [@EthereumFilm](https://twitter.com/EthereumFilm) guys running around with my dog [@sashathefella](https://twitter.com/sashathefella) - less than 10 days.
