My very good friend [@raypaxful](https://twitter.com/raypaxful), CEO of [@paxful](https://twitter.com/paxful) is Muslim

He also speaks up for [@RealRossU](https://twitter.com/RealRossU) who's serving a double life sentence with no parole for starting Silk Road. 

Ray is a huge inspiration and an example of how speaking your mind is the only way to make things better üëè

    Many people who are Catholic, Muslim, Mormon, etc or otherwise agree with me have been watching whether web3 is for them. Many are currently in prominent roles in the industry. I know this b/c they message me (privately of course) to tell me. I wonder why they keep it private?<br />
