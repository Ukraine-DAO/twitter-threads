    Remembering #DAOforActivism and finally joining @Ukraine_DAO, I explore the threads of its catalyst @cryptodrftng, what is tantamount to trip through the Odessa catacombs🧭, but this is wow for those who want to fully experience the formation&#43;work of the first in-war acting DAO🛡️<br />

🌻Most frequently asked question - what is a DAO? 

🔍Everyone has different views on this. We see it as a community with a mission (which can change overtime)

🌱Ukraine DAO's mission and focus change as the events unfold and can always be found here:

    2/ First of all, what is a DAO? The abbreviation is usually defined as Decentralised Autonomous Organisation, which is a bit of a misnomer tbh. <br />
    <br />
    ✨ In my view, a DAO is a community with a mission and usually a blockchain-based wallet.<br />
    <br />
    @Ukraine_DAO is on a mission to save 🇺🇦<br />

💡Our team put a lot of thought into considering what a DAO should be

TLDR of conclusions:

✅ if you want to make a long-lasting impact with a DAO, its structure needs to be adjusted to the mission 

✅ what it means is going to look very different in each particular case

    ✨If you google &#34;what is a DAO?&#34;, what will come up is a definition that doesn&#39;t reflect what Ukraine DAO is very accurately 😂 <br />

✅ It's not necessary to solve every problem at the same time 

✅ whatever you plan in the beginning, problems you don't anticipate will come up down the road and still need to be addressed

    2/ We speak to other Web3 builders like @garysheng, @AaronSoskin and @dimka_eth, and dig deep into organizational studies and other disciplines to try to understand what will work for us and what won&#39;t. Not every problem will be solved immediately but we are doing our best. https://t.co/FMfcAuL2ps<br />
