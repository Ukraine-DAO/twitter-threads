Becoming a part of [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) means I wake up proud of what I'm doing and feel less helpless. Before I joined I was doing what I could, knitting and crocheting baby clothes, donating food and pet supplies but still felt so helpless and that my help wasn't doing much

I desperately wanted to fight. I have fire arms experience that would could in handy but unfortunately I've been in a wheelchair ~14 years now. Now don't get me wrong I don't let that stop me you can often find me doing things people think I can't do such as dangling from

The ceiling doing aerial yoga or down the stables horse riding. However nobody wants to get my arse out of the mud when bullets are flying. Its bad enough at festivals nevermind in a war zone. I hated that feeling of helplessness. 


I was safe in my home here in 🇬🇧 with my two furballs and spidey but I knew that so many in 🇺🇦 or with family and friends there weren't lucky enough to be feeling safe with a monster on their doorstep and facing genocide. I can't even begin to imagine what that must feel

Like. I had seen videos and pictures of men, women and children tortured, bloodied, bruised and their lives robbed from them, MURDERED.  I felt that to my very core. I felt pure and unadulterated helplessness. 

I had been keeping apprised of this situation on every platform

That I could. Here on Twitter one of the accounts I began following was co-founder of [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) Alona [@cryptodrftng](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng). I appreciated her no nonsense reporting, completely unapologetic in her views and sheer dogedness in fighting for her homeland, her family, her friends 


For EVERY single Ukranian both human AND furry. [@cryptodrftng](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng) is very much like myself in that she's not afraid to speak her mind or offend anyone in the process and i really appreciate that value in a person. We began sharing a few DM's and despite the horror of war

And how busy ahe was she still had time to talk to me and genuinely cared about my struggles with my health and disability. Eventually after messaging back and forth she asked me if I wanted to join [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) I paused to Google "what the hell is a DAO?"😹

I didn't want to appear clueless. I sheepishly said yes even though I doubted I would be of much use knowing that I had no previous knowledge of Web3/crypto and that kind of thing but to Alona that didn't matter. What mattered was that I wanted to help 🇺🇦.

I was so grateful for that opportunity, after all the one thing I have an abundance of to donate is my time. I no longer feel helpless, I feel proud and I feel useful. I will use every ounce of my being to support 🇺🇦 and the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦 against the genocide that 10/🧵R

🇷🇺 is commiting. I'll fight propaganda where I see it, educate where I can, support where needed. My gran joked earlier today that I was becoming an honorary Ukranian and she's right because I will fight alongside Ukraine and Ukranianians as much as I would if I had been

Born there. 

I may not be as experienced as other [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) contributors but I know that I am still valued and that my work is important, even the smallest of tasks.

Thank you [@cryptodrftng](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng) for allowing me to be a part of [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) and thank you for what has become a friendship. I look forward to seeing your home in person one day. [#SlavaUkraini](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SlavaUkraini)
