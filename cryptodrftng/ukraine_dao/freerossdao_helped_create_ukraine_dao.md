The other day I was asked whether after Ukraine's victory I'd like to help defend people wrongfully convicted for crypto.

That's what I was doing until the 24th Feb - helping [@RJPinnell](https://twitter.com/RJPinnell) run [@FreeRossDAO](https://twitter.com/FreeRossDAO) 

[@RealRossU](https://twitter.com/RealRossU) is serving double life sentence. For a non-violent offence.

    We loved to see the charity and cause-oriented vaults spring up over the last year.<br />
    <br />
    @FreeRossDAO and @Ukraine_DAO are two of the largest we&#39;ve seen and are thankful for their willingness to push Fractional forward in interesting new ways.<br />

🇺🇦 [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) would never exist without all the continued support of [@FreeRossDAO](https://twitter.com/FreeRossDAO) team - [@rizzn](https://twitter.com/rizzn), [@zencephalon](https://twitter.com/zencephalon), [@Schlomo](https://twitter.com/Schlomo), [@RJPinnell](https://twitter.com/RJPinnell), [@FreeJeremyNet](https://twitter.com/FreeJeremyNet), [@kyledcollins](https://twitter.com/kyledcollins) & many others

    1/ Many of you may wonder what I was doing before @Ukraine_DAO. I was busy helping @RealRossU best friend @RJPinnell with Operations and Community Management in the amazing community called @FreeRossDAO. Without it, Ukraine DAO wouldn’t have been here. Why should you join them? https://t.co/KfnbGuOwfK<br />

BTW, Ross Ulbricht was never charged with attempted murder which is what many people believe due to a smear campaign in the media. 

[@RealRossU](https://twitter.com/RealRossU) doesn't deserve to die in prison.

The reason why it's so important to have [@RealRossU](https://twitter.com/RealRossU) released is very simple:

❣️crypto adoption would be nowhere near its current level without Ross

❗️if we as a society put up an injustice like that, we shouldn't be surprised if we are next

    I’m sometimes asked if I’m ashamed of working to help free @RealRossU from prison. <br />
    <br />
    Spending a lot of time on Ross&#39;s cause was a privilege I had before 🇷🇺 started full-scale invasion of Ukraine. <br />

Approach "I'm ignorant and therefore you should be careful to not alienate me" doesn't actually help - whether that's about Ross or Azov in 🇺🇦

Whoever says that are concerned about their emotional comfort than the cause itself. 

They should educate themselves instead.

We spoke about [@RealRossU](https://twitter.com/RealRossU) with [@ghappour](https://twitter.com/ghappour) who also worked on his case, in the Twitter Space we did back in June about threat models of communications in Ukraine. 

Need to undig the recording and upload to our Youtube channel 🌱

While I have your attention - please let educate yourself about Azov, everyone.

I met Azov's representatives in Kyiv a couple weeks ago and not only survived that but hope to meet them again 😹

You know whom I never met growing up in Eastern Ukraine & speaking russian to friends? 

"Ukrainian Nazis", lol 🦄

In case you feel the sudden urge to educate me about Ukrainian "extremism" with links, photos and other products of 🇷🇺 propaganda and give me "context":

❗️I'm actually from there, so I don't need your "context" what-so-ever 🪄

Last but least: [@MuKappa](https://twitter.com/MuKappa) is one of [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) Fact Checking & Media Literacy Pod Leads 

❣️Great follow for anyone interested in 🇷🇺 propaganda and also a subject that doesn't get enough media attention:

🚨 russian Nazism 🚨

📞 [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) you guys want to cover? 👀

Sorry, forgot to add something else: if it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck,  it's a duck. 

It's not just [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) who spread 🇷🇺 propaganda - [@bellingcat](https://twitter.com/bellingcat) is on our list of 🇷🇺 "foreign assets" too.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    @nemapovnovazhen They&#39;re wrong about the russian asset because they are russian assets. https://t.co/zzG5ANFgeS<br />

Some people tell me and [@MuKappa](https://twitter.com/MuKappa) that [@bellingcat](https://twitter.com/bellingcat) are "reputable"

❗️This only makes the fact that they share false information and promote [@ColborneMichael](https://twitter.com/ColborneMichael)'s BS much worse

❗️Disinformation is a weapon. That weapon has made this war possible. Shouldn't be news to them.

    <br />
    ❓Forgive my ignorance but was imaginary Jewish &#34;extremism&#34; studied during the Holocaust too?<br />
