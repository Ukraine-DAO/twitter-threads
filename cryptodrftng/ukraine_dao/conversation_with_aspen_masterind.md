From [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) team, I was joined today by the amazing [@CECILIESTURICH](https://twitter.com/CECILIESTURICH), [@djw155](https://twitter.com/djw155) and [@NanTyrus](https://twitter.com/NanTyrus) ✨

Highlights the discussion:

✨ [@brokenpixelua](https://twitter.com/brokenpixelua) asked "шо по русні"? in the Q&A section and I duly anwered that "русні пизда" 💞 

✨ [@M0TRN](https://twitter.com/M0TRN) whom I haven't spoken to before ...

✨... joined the discussion to tell everyone that after reading my Twitter he is now a "russophob" too and proud of it! 

I don't think I've ever felt prouder in my life 😂 Thank you for speaking, [@M0TRN](https://twitter.com/M0TRN) !
