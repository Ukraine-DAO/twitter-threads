✨He also spent a lot of time in Eastern Ukraine, Donetsk in particular in back in 2015.

❗️ The total number of "Ukrainian Nazis" he met in Ukraine & russia-occupied territories is ZERO.

🦄 "Ukrainian Nazis" are fictional characters made up by 🇷🇺 propaganda machine.

    After all the indescribable suffering that russia has inflicted on Ukraine, if it&#39;s still the &#34;Ukrainian Nazis&#34; that concern you and you&#39;re worried about safety of russians who are &#34;not to blame&#34; - you&#39;re sick in your head. <br />
    <br />
    Ukrainians shouldn&#39;t have to listen to this bullshit.<br />

Comment from myself: 

❗️Ukraine's only real problem with Nazism is russia and its apologists in the West. 

❗️russia needs to be denazified, demilitarized and cease to exist in its current form.

    Azov are our heroes and they play a crucial role in defending Ukraine against r*ssian genocidal invasion, which is the only reason r*ssua is so butthurt about them. https://t.co/HVbt4d5LDB https://t.co/IqfvuGFnbH<br />

Azov Regiment needs international support & defence from constant russian information attacks.

🇷🇺 is terrified of Azov because its army is only capable of looting, raping and murdering civilians - [twitter.com/cryptodrftng/s…](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1531480089963151366?s=21&t=i9hVofndaa7AmReoZn0WzQ)

    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    4. Denazification of russia.<br />
    5. Demilitarization of russia.<br />
    6. Regime change.<br />
    7. Roll russia back to its historic borders as of 24 Feb 1122. https://t.co/OZW6It86IM https://t.co/5pvoaoeKkv<br />

    1/ This has to be heard by everyone. <br />
    <br />
    🇷🇺 sends to 🇺🇦 the people whose deaths it doesn&#39;t mind - in 🇷🇺 culture that&#39;s pretty much anyone. They don&#39;t value human life.<br />
    <br />
    Meanwhile, 🇺🇦 sacrifices its most precious people. We lost @ratushnyi_r a few days ago.<br />

A 🧵 about the US defending its interests by supporting Ukraine - something that every country should be doing.

    1/ Glad he said this.<br />
    <br />
    The US is acting for its self interest indeed. And so should other countries.<br />
    <br />
    Global famine that russia is now organising is not going to do good on anyone&#39;s economy except russia&#39;s.<br />
