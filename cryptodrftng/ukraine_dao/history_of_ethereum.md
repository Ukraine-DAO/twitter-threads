✨Happy birthday, Ethereum chain!

🌱 Many people associate crypto with chasing profits, but there is so much more to it. 

📣 Ethereum has given me a voice after years of me saying the same things I say now - but having no platform 💔

[@VitalikButerin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin) found the time and empathy to call me in the very beginning of the full scale invasion, and to really hear me 

He has since shown unapologetic support to Ukraine ❤️🖤

    Just got off a very long call with @VitalikButerin that was probably the most surreal thing in my life - never thought I’d speak to him.<br />
    <br />
    Beyond grateful to him for taking the time to speak to me and all the support and empathy he had. Слава Украине! #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦❤️<br />
