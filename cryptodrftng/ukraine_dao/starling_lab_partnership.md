To say this is a bittersweet feeling would be a huge understatement but I'm so happy we made this happen with Jonathan's team and two actual üá∫üá¶legends - [@o_karpovych](https://twitter.com/o_karpovych) and [@sa_sharm](https://twitter.com/sa_sharm) 

This is going to make a big impact in terms of justice being served for üá∫üá¶

18 February vs 12 June 

I wish all of this never ever happened in the first place but this is the best we could do in terms of fighting against [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) and holding russians accountable for the atrocities they're committing as you're reading this tweet

    Just had the most heartbreaking conversation with my family who don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll still have reception in the morning. Watch what Russia does now, we need to make sure they don‚Äôt get away with this. #Ukraine https://t.co/dMUyyNdSE6<br />

    Each of us has been in agony from 1000s propaganda cuts. Literally, lie on a lie on a lie.<br />

Last but not least [@brokenpixelua](https://twitter.com/brokenpixelua) video where he explains why Ukrainians shouldn't listen about "russophobia", and russian people being "victims" or god forbid "heroes".

"It's too late to be a hero."
