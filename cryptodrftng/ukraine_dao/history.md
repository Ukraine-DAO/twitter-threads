❓Is [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) (UKD) incorporated as a charity in 🇬🇧 or elsewhere? - 🧵

✅ There's no reason for UKD to incorporate in 🇬🇧 just because I'm based here 

✅ Despite being a grassroots project, we are lucky to have support of [@mintsyfra](https://twitter.com/mintsyfra) 👇

✨ We created a precedent for a DAO to not only co-exist with a state government peacefully but to help and support each other 🌱  

🎉 It's worth noting - from the very beginning & to this day our work is autonomous from 🇺🇦 government - we cooperate because we want to (!)

The 🧵 below is a great place to learn how [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) came about to exist 👇

    The Telegram chat that turned into @Ukraine_DAO was set up on 21 Feb - 3 days before the genocidal invasion 💔 https://t.co/S6Uo909e9Y<br />

I knew that the full scale invasion was going to happen since 19th January, almost 6 weeks before the 24 Feb.

❗️Info support that we are now providing for 🇺🇦, I've been doing it since 2013, for almost 10 years. 

Ukraine DAO in a way is a product of my anger & frustration.

    1/ Looked through my camera roll from the weeks preceding the full scale invasion on 24th February. This was posted on my Insta stories on the 20th Feb. One day later, @Ukraine_DAO was born.  <br />

🌱 Ukraine DAO has quickly grown far beyond fundraising.

I struggle to think of the type of support we haven't provided 

We accept donations but aren't actively fundraising (except for promoting smaller fundraisers for our team members - where funds do not go through us)

Going back to the original question - given the current framework in which [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) operates + the special nature of the project, I personally don't see any benefit incorporating it as a charity

❗️This may change in the future and it's just a personal view.
