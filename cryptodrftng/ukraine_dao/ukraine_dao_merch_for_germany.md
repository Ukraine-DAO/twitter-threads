People have been asking us for [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) merch so we are considering to appeal to the German segment of the community first.

    @cryptodrftng @SymkinM Apparently Google doesn&#39;t happen to be in the knowing of such. But I do hope Germans will finally understand that ruzzia would blackmail them no matter what. It&#39;s not about Ukraine but about the nature of how ruzzia conducts its business. Wanna put an end to it? Support Ukraine. https://t.co/F6rKiapMcf<br />
