A couple weeks ago I called a taxi in Ivano-Frankivsk. The driver was from [#Mariupol](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mariupol)

He told me the city had been flourishing the last few years. Everything was being refurbished, lots of new playgrounds for kids, very good roads. 

russians killed everyone they could there.

    What you can see:<br />
    - Ukrainian russian speaking cities prosper<br />
    - Ukrainians in occupied regions traveled to Ukraine to get payments<br />
    - Ukrainians don&#39;t tolerate stolen elections<br />
    - Ukraine presidents (except for Yanukovich) peacefully transfer the power<br />

He also said something very poignant:

"When I was shown the photos of my flat, there was barely anything left of it at all.

I felt happy and relieved.

Because I knew the russians couldn't live in it."

Even for those of us who are not from Mariupol, it's a trauma forever.

The extent of suffering that russians brought for no reason can't even be put into human language. 

On the most painful days, all that "good russians" abroad were worrying about was "russophobia".
