🧠 Why you should NOT host Twitter Spaces involving Ukrainians if your ability to empathise with them & maintain composure is impaired - 🧵

❗️First of all, I'd like to mention:

✨ I'm very familiar with mental health struggles

✨have been through therapy 

✨have been on medication to treat Generalised Anxiety Disorder, but haven't been taking it for a long time

🧠 People often tell me that some hosts of Spaces "for 🇺🇦" that are abusive to me & other 🇺🇦 people suffer from mental health issues

My position is very simple:

❗️If that prevents them from being respectful to 🇺🇦 people, they shouldn't host such Spaces.

Easy as that.

📝 In this interview with [@samuel_haig](https://twitter.com/samuel_haig) of [@DefiantNews](https://twitter.com/DefiantNews) from 02 March '22 I talked about the need to support 🇺🇦 mental health as much as possible

❤️ I'm very grateful that Masha then stepped up to lead [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) [@MindfulWebz](https://twitter.com/MindfulWebz) that provides this type of help.

I've also had many breakdowns over the last 4 months

❤️ I was fortunate to have caring people, including our team member & my close friend [@garbanzo0813](https://twitter.com/garbanzo0813), who was there for me when I felt like I didn't want to be in such a horrible, indifferent world anymore.

✨ I'm also dealing with a disability that's extremely difficult to manage and means that every time I go to bed, I don't know for sure if I'll wake up again 

✨ Not exactly the right person to listen about how someone's 🧠 issue makes it ok for them to abuse me - it doesn't.

    1/ Over the last 100&#43; days, I&#39;ve had all sorts of breakdowns and I&#39;m extremely mentally stable person.<br />
    I&#39;ve stared at the wall all day (before the invasion, afterwards I didn&#39;t have the time)<br />
    I&#39;ve cried for hours.<br />
    I&#39;ve told close friends I don&#39;t want to be in this world anymore. https://t.co/eZxkm5683z<br />

    Not sure why I have to explain it, but:<br />
    ❗Anyone who has bullied me or any other 🇺🇦 person is not welcome in Spaces run by @Ukraine_DAO  team<br />
    <br />
    &#34;I do not need permission to contribute&#34;<br />
    <br />
    ❗ Yes, you do. Our Twitter Spaces are highly moderated to protect mental health of Ukrainians.<br />
