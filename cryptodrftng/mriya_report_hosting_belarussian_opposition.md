🚨 What's up with "fReEDOm oF sPeEcH", [@MriyaReport](https://twitter.com/MriyaReport)? 🧐

You loved lecturing me about it every time I got mistreated in your spaces 

✨ Did it fall out of the window together with Germany's "dEmOcrAcY"  and your Space's reputation tonight? 🤣

    The Euromaidan actually stopped being about the EU association agreement and turned into the Revolution of Dignity very quickly.<br />
    <br />
    It happened as we could not allow Kremlin&#39;s puppets to violate our right to peaceful protest.<br />

Dear Western audience,

the impotent 🇧🇾 "oppositioners" are bleating about not having support from the West

By saying this they disclose a very telling thing 🤣

They say to you: 

✨solve MY problems that I caused MYSELF  and support ME while Ukrainians are paying the price ✨

❗️People of 🇧🇾  let russian tanks roll through their land to invade 🇺🇦 

❗️They helped ruZZians attack Kyiv oblast

Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel all happened because of them

❗️They should be too ashamed to join a public discussion in their lifetime 

❗️They want you to support THEM

    One of them replies to me she doesn’t want war and that actually in Belarus you can be spend the night in jail for a protest. <br />
    <br />
    ❗️Whilst my family and my people are  showing incredible courage invaded by a huge horde of ocs, under nukes (!)  threats.<br />
    <br />
    Let that sink in.<br />

❗️Being Ukrainian is hell these days. 

I cannot describe this pain with words - it's beyond human, and you know what?

❗️I'd NEVER trade being Ukrainian for anything - including being released from this pain. 

We have something more important - we'll NEVER be pathetic like 🇧🇾

    Back in 2020 I went to every demonstration against Lukashenko&#39;s regime I knew of - newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes &#43; with a small puppy <br />
    <br />
    If ruSSia ever threatened to invade 🇧🇾 through 🇺🇦, I&#39;d get on the plane. <br />
    <br />
    I&#39;d never let the ruSSians use my land to kill my friends.<br />

In other "news"

After all that ruSSians did  to the Crimean Tatars in the past, since 2014 -  AGAIN persecuted 
❗️tortures
❗️arbitrary imprisonments
❗️disappearances

30,000  had to flee

Then this 🇧🇾 scum turns around in MR  to say we had it easy as "we didn't lose anyone"
