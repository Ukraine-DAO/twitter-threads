    1/ Over the last 100&#43; days, I&#39;ve had all sorts of breakdowns and I&#39;m extremely mentally stable person.<br />
    I&#39;ve stared at the wall all day (before the invasion, afterwards I didn&#39;t have the time)<br />
    I&#39;ve cried for hours.<br />
    I&#39;ve told close friends I don&#39;t want to be in this world anymore. https://t.co/eZxkm5683z<br />
