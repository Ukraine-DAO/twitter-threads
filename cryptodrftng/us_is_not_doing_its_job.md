‚ùå Whatever russians say, sign etc is irrelevant  - what matters is what they do.

    77 years ago following 2/3 approval of each part, final text of UN Charter was unanimously adopted by delegates &amp; opened for signature on 26 June 1945; it was signed in San Francisco by 50 of the 51 original member countries.

    35/ I&#39;m often reminded by people about the importance of international law. I have two law degrees with distinction and here&#39;s my preferred response: &#34;is the international law in the room with us right now?&#34; Attaching the meme in case anyone wants to follow my example. https://t.co/qVnwr7HUBV https://t.co/mjbJ4wnm9p<br />

We don't even need to go *that* far in the past, [@MadMax25678931](https://twitter.com/MadMax25678931). 

‚ÅâÔ∏è Today, ruSSia is still on the [@UN](https://twitter.com/UN) "Security Council" which gives it power to veto any resolutions.

üí∞The total budget for [@UN](https://twitter.com/UN) "peacekeeping" for 2021-2022 is $6.38 billion: [sgp.fas.org/crs/row/IF1059‚Ä¶](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/IF10597.pdf)

    @cryptodrftng Sure sure int&#39;l law. Now tell me what was its use when ruzzia invaded Ukraine in 2014 and in 2022? What was its use when ruizza invaded Georgia in 2008? Just outta the top of one&#39;s head, gimme some concrete examples how the aforementioned law deterred the rogue gas station.<br />

Very good question.

[@SergiyKyslytsya](https://twitter.com/SergiyKyslytsya) shared the [@UN](https://twitter.com/UN) charter.

A lot of people believe that [@UN](https://twitter.com/UN) are useful and to me it's an opportunity to remind everyone that [@UN](https://twitter.com/UN) are effectively helping üá∑üá∫ commit [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) 

Comparable only with [@ICRC](https://twitter.com/ICRC) - [twitter.com/cryptodrftng/s‚Ä¶](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1536615600801427456?s=21&t=Rm1iZdswEpJLuiGkB__uOw)

    @cryptodrftng @UN Basically we&#39;ve arrived at the conclusion that the talked about int&#39;l law is a joke. Plain and simple. So why would one remind anyone of it? What good would that do? I stopped listening to what people say but I surely observe what they do instead and make my own conclusions.<br />
