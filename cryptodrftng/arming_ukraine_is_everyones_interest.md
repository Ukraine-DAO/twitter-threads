Glad he said this.

The US is acting for its self interest indeed. And so should other countries.

Global famine that russia is now organising is not going to do good on anyone's economy except russia's.

That's why EVERY country should do everything it can to [#ArmUkraineNow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArmUkraineNow)

If the US gets involved it’s usually for it’s own self interests. Most of the time it’s for resources or business interests.<br />

Helping Ukraine is not charity. You are saving yourself by doing that. Ukrainian men and women pick up weapons so that you don't have to.

Ukrainians are sacrificing their lives, for people from other countries, there is still an option to just have financial inconvenience - very minor one, compared to the nightmare it will snowball into if the drug cartels with tanks AKA 🇷🇺 isn't stopped.

    1/ This has to be heard by everyone. <br />
    <br />
    🇷🇺 sends to 🇺🇦 the people whose deaths it doesn&#39;t mind - in 🇷🇺 culture that&#39;s pretty much anyone. They don&#39;t value human life.<br />
    <br />
    Meanwhile, 🇺🇦 sacrifices its most precious people. We lost @ratushnyi_r a few days ago.<br />

P.S. in case you didn't know, [@StephenKolanko1](https://twitter.com/StephenKolanko1), money is actually a lot less valuable than human life.

They didn't teach you that at your Third Reich University, did they? Having to learn from a Ukrainian person about it must be a tough pill to swallow 💞
