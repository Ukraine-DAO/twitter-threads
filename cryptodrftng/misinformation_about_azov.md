Thank you for sharing [@LvivNightingale](https://twitter.com/LvivNightingale)!

I'd like to add my parents' perspectives here too.  [#Íë≠](https://twitter.com/hashtag/%EA%91%AD) [#SaveAzov](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaveAzov) [twitter.com/LvivNightingal‚Ä¶](https://twitter.com/LvivNightingale/status/1539850257898545152)

My dad served in East Germany when he was in the army and then spent this whole life working on internal affairs matters. 

He's now doing incredible things to support UA Armed Forces. 

He knows about üá∫üá¶ a little more than "fact checkers" from [@snopes](https://twitter.com/snopes) 

This is what he said:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    Dad called while I was addressing Azov here so I mentioned it to him üòÇ<br />
    <br />
    Direct quote: <br />
    <br />
    &#34;Are they joking?! Azov is part of the National Guard, which is subordinate to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. It&#39;s not a political organisation!&#34; <br />
    <br />
    He&#39;s lucky to not see this BS every day.<br />

Mum was more concise - she is an actual savage, so this was her being diplomatic.

    Forgot to say: also mentioned the Azov drama to mum. <br />
    &#34;Tell all the people talking shit about Azov there to stop embarrassing themselves and shut the fuck up&#34;‚ù§Ô∏è<br />

    1/ So let me make sure I got this right:<br />
    <br />
    1) @snopes call themselves &#34;fact-checkers&#34; ? <br />
    <br />
    2) The author, Bethania Palma, is a &#34;journalist&#34;? <br />
    <br />
    Is that supposed to be correct? https://t.co/hXQlAAVcZt https://t.co/F2Hsoc3aVZ<br />
