    @cryptodrftng Those generally are &#34;presents&#34; to remind you to think of Sasha.<br />
    <br />
    Once had a roommate who brought a cat into house.<br />
    <br />
    The cat was named Pooh, asked my roommate if it was like Winny the Pooh and she didn&#39;t answer.<br />
    <br />
    So had the experience with some else&#39;s pet.<br />
