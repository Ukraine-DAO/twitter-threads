# ‚ö°Ô∏èUNSOLICITED ADIVCE TO UKRAINIANS ‚ö°Ô∏è 

Author: [–ê–ª—å–æ–Ω–∞ Íë≠ –®–µ–≤—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng)  
*Links to this thread: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1536615572229832704), [PingThread](https://pingthread.com/thread/1536615572229832704), [ThreadReader](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1536615572229832704.html), [Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1536615572229832704)*

Recently I've been receiving a lot of unsolicited advice. I know that the vast majority of people giving that advice meant well and they thought they were helping me. My issue with it is that it's often repetitive, even more often - ignorant and in some cases - insulting.

I'm a very open person and I'm pretty sure that I take in feedback and constructive criticism pretty well. A couple months ago I went for a walk with [@serjtys](https://twitter.com/serjtys) who was considering joining [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) and he said he was considering joining us but we were not transparent enough.

My response was that he was completely right. Most of our documentation at the time was in the process of being written up and I'm not even sure the Fundamentals were live yet. We started writing faster and there's a huge improvement now. He did joinüíô

[ukraine-dao.notion.site: Fundamentals - Mission & Values](https://ukraine-dao.notion.site/Fundamentals-Mission-Values-54d3355f52f24354be085a970fbb9dd9)

I receive some negative feedback about how I communicate things about Germany, [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters), [@UN](https://twitter.com/UN), [@ICRC](https://twitter.com/ICRC) etc. The only thing I can say to that - that's me being extremely patient and diplomatic. They should be getting a lot worse.

When I need advice, I explicitly ask for it. In the early days of Ukraine DAO I asked my mentor and very good friend [@BlockGeekDima](https://twitter.com/BlockGeekDima) how I should go about "controversial" topics and I'm grateful that he encouraged me to just speak my mind, which is what I've been doing.

    7/ Forever grateful for all the love we get - not sure where I would be right now without the mentorship &amp; support 8of @BlockGeekDima. He gave me the most valuable advice at some point - to remain authentic, just the way I am. Very happy I have followed this advice so far. https://t.co/GtS4PpRCWP<br />

I used to work in litigation law and it's an environment where you have to kinda constantly have this "fa√ßade" that may have nothing to do with what you're actually like and if you don't fit in, you won't get very far. Intelligence, talent etc are secondary.
[#ArmUkraineNow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArmUkraineNow)

I left and started working on Web3 projects because it's an environment where you can:

1Ô∏è‚É£ stay anonymous if that's what you prefer for whatever reason 

2Ô∏è‚É£ find a community where you will be embraced with your quirks 

[#ArmUkraineNow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArmUkraineNow)

I don't see any point trying to communicate things in a way that's convenient to everyone and doesn't insult anyone. Trust me, Ukrainians have tried being diplomatic for years - it didn't help. If my tweets are the most shocking thind you've seen all day - I'm happy for you.

üá∫üá¶ people mostly have no issue whatsoever with how I speak. I communicate normal thoughts of a Ukrainian person. I don't ask everyone to agree with me either. But equally I don't back off when someone is saying nonsense. If they don't stop - I leave.

If you support Ukraine but what I say deeply offends you - that's an opportunity to pause and think: if I'm so offended by what she said on Twitter, how would I feel if it was my people accused of being Nazis every day while being killed for no reason?
[#ArmUkraineNow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArmUkraineNow)

When speaking to Ukrainians, please consider the impact of what you say on our mental health. I'm very stress-resilient and just generally used to bullying of all sorts. Not every Ukrainian person is.

Our contributor [@NovelSci](https://twitter.com/NovelSci) wrote an absolutely amazing üßµ about how to talk to Ukrainians. I strongly recommend everyone to read it.

And please, for the love of god, stop calling russians "heroes" in our presence.

P.S. Before I make a serious accusation, I've thought about it a million times. 

‚úÖ The üá©üá™ government sold their own country to üá∑üá∫ 

‚úÖ [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) is the üá©üá™ of journalism

‚úÖ [@UN](https://twitter.com/UN) & [@ICRC](https://twitter.com/ICRC) should be dissolved 

It's on them to fix themselves, not on me to be more diplomatic.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    4/ Believe it or not, but prior to Feb 2022 I was scared of public speaking and wasn&#39;t spending time arguing online. Unfortunately, the world failed us.
