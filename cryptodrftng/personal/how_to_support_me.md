# What does Alona do and how can you support her work

Author: [Альона ꑭ Шевченко](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng)

✨A NEW WAY TO PISS OFF THE r*SSSIAN FASCISTS IS HERE ✨

Привіт! My name is Alona, I'm the co-founder of [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO). One of the things I specialise in is being an unapologetic Ukrainian.

💌 There is now an option for you to support my work 👇

[www.buymeacoffee.com: Alona Shevchenko is being an unapologetic Ukrainian](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/cryptodrftng)

Many people have Patreon but I am not a massive fan of them - as you can guess from the screenshot below 🥲

✨ Not entirely sure what will be happening on my [@buymeacoffee](https://twitter.com/buymeacoffee) page yet but there will definitely be "things going on", as my friend [@Schlomo](https://twitter.com/Schlomo) says.

    I&#39;m considering setting up a page like Patreon but I don&#39;t want it to be Patreon because I&#39;m pissed off at what they did when @BackAndAlive needed help. So I share other people&#39;s Patreon pages but don&#39;t want to on it myself. If anyone knows any good alternatives, let me know ❤️ https://t.co/E96DpndnIc https://t.co/W0L1YWjCfI<br />

My work in the info space is focused on:
✨defence of Ukraine
✨supporting Azov Regiment
✨amplifying 🇺🇦 voices
✨highlighting the horrifying nature of the 🇷🇺 "culture"
✨Web3 and cybersecurity literacy
✨shitposting through the invasion as a form of coping mechanism

    <br />
    Welcome to all new followers, my name is Alona, I&#39;m Ukrainian and I&#39;m here to tell you why the russian state must cease to exist and why it should be everyone&#39;s priority to #ArmUkraineNow 🇺🇦 https://t.co/UkNZXixVGl<br />

✨ I write about Ukraine, white on white colonialism, and "good russians" (AKA svynosobaky) so much that my team has to maintain a whole database with tags in this Notion page 🏷

I'm also one of very few people in this world who brag about being accused of funds embezzlement 🤣 

🦄 If 🇷🇺 FSB-itches hate you so much that they start throwing ridiculous false accusations and embarrass themselves publicly - that's a sign you're doing something right 💓

They've deleted those posts long ago because the reputational damage became unbearable🎀

But my own take about what they represent and what's wrong with it remains - because it's accurate. We use this story as a case study about "good russians" now (they don't exist, btw) 👇

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ Wow. I&#39;ve been purposefully avoiding talking about @pussyrrriot publicly but I guess I haven&#39;t been left with a choice (no pun intended, @TheChoiceDAO) <br />

🪆Now that we've covered the modern day "good russians", here's the view I promote about the dead russian "artists"

✨ r*ssian culture is garbage and that garbage is dangerous af ✨

✨getting rid of it is the least everyone can do to help Ukraine ✨

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ Sorry but no, the 🇷🇺 literature is really not essential in understanding man. The nature of the &#34;mysterious 🇷🇺  soul&#34; can be seen in #Mariupol these days💔<br />

On a more positive note - I'm extremely grateful about all the love I get ❤️

It means the world for Ukrainians to know that they're not on their own

I keep some of the loving messages I receive in this 🧵 and look at them when I feel miserable (read: often)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ Starting 🧵 for the kind messages I get every day. I believe they&#39;re addressed to all Ukrainian people - my struggles are nothing compared to what Ukrainians on the ground in the warzone have been through. I hope all this warm energy cheers them up too ❤️<br />

Pretty sure I have undiagnosed ADHD so I feel like I'm getting distracted again 🥲

Attaching below the single most important 🧵 I want everyone to read. It's about what it's like to be Ukrainian.

📝 I also have a blog called "Drftng with Ukraine" - [cryptodrftng.substack.com: Drftng with Ukraine](https://cryptodrftng.substack.com)

    1/ Ukrainians don&#39;t complain much but I hope they don&#39;t mind me saying this: I speak 4 languages and none of them has words that can describe how much it hurts to be one of us these days. <br />
    <br />
    Each of us has been in agony from 1000s propaganda cuts. Literally, lie on a lie on a lie.<br />

✨Last but not least, a bit of inspirational wisdom from me:

1. Never (!) be scared of nasty bitches -  make nasty bitches scared of you 🌸

2. Don't let russians ruin your day. Ruin their day first 💅

Attaching here a 🧵 with a brief history of my activism - lots of photos there.

This war would not be happening right now if Ukrainian voices were listened to - and heard - sooner.

Meme I posted in 2013:

"- I have bad news for you
- What???
- I will not sign the EU association agreement
- "I will not sign the EU association agreement", my ass" 

Surrender was never an option and we've always used memes to communicate it 🔪

When you see me trolling [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) "journalists" asking them wtf is "Kiev", and advising to seek medical help - I didn't start doing this yesterday
