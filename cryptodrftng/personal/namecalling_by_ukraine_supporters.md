Attaching in the tweet below a very outdated and incomplete list of things I've been recently called by Ukraine's "supporters"🇺🇦

    honestly the past few months have really shattered my belief in humanity. I&#39;m grateful for the people I&#39;ve met on twitter who know what is right but the betrayal I&#39;ve felt from hearing people I trusted talk about Ukraine with contempt has irrevocably changed how I view the world<br />

Here's what happened in a "OSINT" space whose hosts claim to be supportive of 🇺🇦. Note how at no point that person is removed, interrupted or even just told that what they were saying was inappropriate. Instead of apologising, the hosts then started to harassing me themselves.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

    1/ Expectations for a Ukrainian: Apologise to russians.<br />
    <br />
    This conversation happened in Twitter Spaces a couple days ago in front of 400 people. Sharing so it&#39;s easier to understand what I have to deal with every other day. <br />

"How to not lose your shit when someone is shouting at you 101"

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    When I speak in various Twitter Spaces, there&#39;s often someone shouting at me within the first few minutes. I know what I&#39;m talking about so I can speak confidently without having to scream. If you can&#39;t be more composed than me, your hurt feelings are not going to affect me. https://t.co/Fz5vmJxzua<br />

Why I don't ignore always this (btw, most of the time I do ignore):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    65/ I&#39;m told to ignore this all the time. I can&#39;t ignore something I have to deal with every single day. It&#39;s not a one-off incident, this patronising imperialist attitude is everywhere. It&#39;s like &#34;Be grateful that we are supporting Ukraine and shut up&#34;. Who is supported exactly? https://t.co/yjrscDZQOy<br />

Western arrogance ignoring Ukrainian voices:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

russophobia = holiding russians accountable. In that sense, everyone should be "russophobic".

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    35/ Every other day I&#39;m shouted at publicly, told that I have a horrible attitude, and that I should be ashamed of the radical things I say. My radical &#34;russophobia&#34; means holding russians accountable to the same standard as others would be. On an individual level. Wild idea 🤯<br />

Before you have a go at a Ukrainian person, make sure you gave the same energy to the person abusing them.

Also - don't have a go at the Ukrainian person. Just don't.

Some people mistakenly took this as me disparaging WR which wasn't the intention behind this 🧵 at all. 

Walter is Ukrainian, he works a lot and he isn't always there to step in. 

The behaviour of [@OSINT88](https://twitter.com/OSINT88) who is yet to apologise is what I had a problem with.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ A few people have asked me what happened today, so I&#39;d like to explain. There was a conversation happening in @walter_report Twitter Spaces about @Reuters. <br />
    <br />
    Both me and @gujingc started our comments from saying that we are aware that not all @Reuters journalists are corrupt. https://t.co/oR2xbQe3XG<br />

    The reason I highlight the standards that Ukrainians are held to &amp; the abuse bullies get away with, is this:<br />

    It&#39;s a great question! @MuKappa, myself and the rest of our team are being targeted for a few reasons:<br />
    1) I don&#39;t like to be reduced to a &#34;miserable victim&#34; which is the only type of person that many &#34;Ukraine&#39;s supporters&#34; are prepared to face<br />

[@HansWorldTravls](https://twitter.com/HansWorldTravls) / [@UkrainesGrains](https://twitter.com/UkrainesGrains) spends day and night writing nonsense articles about me in his blog [hanshyde.com: Hans Hyde](https://hanshyde.com)
1) BTW, an "energy specialist" should know  - loss is only realised when assets are sold for a price lower than the purchase price:)
2) "eThErIum" 😂

BTW, Ukraine DAO doesn't "make" or "lose" any funds because the transactions are sent to the recipients - [@BackAndAlive](https://twitter.com/BackAndAlive), [@Ukraine](https://twitter.com/Ukraine), [@OutRightIntl](https://twitter.com/OutRightIntl) etc in crypto, without converting them to fiat first.
