While the drug cartel with tanks AKA 🇷🇺 is busy killing 🇺🇦 civilians, my friends from London [@stookisound](https://twitter.com/stookisound) and [@OutlawTheArtist](https://twitter.com/OutlawTheArtist) are preparing to drop the kind of bomb that I like - will be released next week.

In this 🧵 I'll tell you about one of my best friends - Jelacee 💚 [pic.twitter.com/y1sG1QpfGn](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1538595430958759937/video/1)

I knew [@stookisound](https://twitter.com/stookisound) way before I even came to the UK for the first time in 2013. Like a lot of young people in Ukraine, I was really into trap/EDM music and they were the people behind the absolute trap anthem - a lot of you may recognise this track.

I connected with Jelacee when I was still in 🇺🇦
Once I came to 🇬🇧, he brought me to one of his shows in Brighton and we've been friends ever since 💚 

[@stookisound](https://twitter.com/stookisound) were in Ukraine in 2014 when 🇷🇺 invaded and got escorted from the venue to the airport with a 🇺🇦military convoy

Jelacee has a hilarious story about how he got detained at the airport when vigilant Ukrainians wondered  why two black guys from London came to visit 🇺🇦 for just 1 day - the night before 🇷🇺 invaded. I'm sure [@johnsweeneyroar](https://twitter.com/johnsweeneyroar) with his [@brokenpixelua](https://twitter.com/brokenpixelua) adventures can relate.

He was also the first friend I onboarded to Web3 🌱

He's hella smart and a couple weeks later was telling me about some blockchain projects I've never even heard of 😂

Here is Jelacee's Instagram, btw [instagram.com: jELACEE.'s (@jelacee) profile on Instagram • 12 posts](https://instagram.com/jelacee) 

Sharing  📷 of him from Sasha's bad hair days 💔

Once he brought a mini-speaker with him to show me the new tracks. A day later I got an email from my building manager saying that the music we were listening to on the fourth floor, the neighbours could hear on the ground floor 🤣🤣

- Jamal, what do you need to reply with when I say "Слава Україні"? Come on, I taught you this.
- "Safe, g"?
