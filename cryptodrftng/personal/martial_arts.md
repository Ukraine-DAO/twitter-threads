🥋MARTIAL ARTS - 🧵 

I think training very actively (up until Feb) helped me loads in terms of coping with all the emotions over the last few months

That's what I was mostly training for - Brazilian jiu-jitsu in particular develops you as a person and keeps you humble

Btw, jiujitsu entered my life the same weekend I jumped out of a plane🤣

Back in autumn 2019, I skydived to raise funds for a UK-based charity supporting 🇺🇦 children - [www.ukrainecharity.org: Ukraine Charity - Helping disadvantaged children in Ukraine](https://www.ukrainecharity.org)

Skydiving wasn't scary at all - awesome experience which I can't wait to repeat

When I got back from Cambridgeshire to London after this, I felt too tired to go to that self-defence workshop I'd booked and almost didn't go, but then last moment changed my mind.

At that workshop I absolutely fell in love with jiujitsu and signed up to the school

My friends were making jokes like "Alona is clearly preparing to join the army or something - jumped off the plane and is learning how to fight🤣"

Now I'm in the Digital Forces of Ukraine😂

Brazilian jiujitsu (BJJ) is not the kind of thing you can make serious progress in if you train once week. 

I was very dedicated to it - not because I want to be great at fighting, but because I really enjoy it, which helped me get through some difficult times in life

    ✨I trained Brazilian jiujitsu for over 2 years, almost every day before the full scale invasion started. I&#39;d often get up at 5am to go to a 7am class and then be at work on time by 9. <br />
    <br />
    ✨A lot of the skills you learn through martial arts can be applied in other areas of life. https://t.co/Xtm60GrDmo https://t.co/nS4b0zsjJM<br />

In spring 2020 when I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, the first question I asked the doctors about was whether I'd still be able to train 🤣

Last summer I almost rejected a job offer because I thought that job would mess with training (it did😅)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

    1/ In March 2020, just as the pandemic was hitting the UK where I&#39;m based, I was diagnosed with #type1diabetes which is an incurable autoimmune disorder that requires extremely complex care. Exhausted rn but will later post about life with a disability in this 🧵 https://t.co/xdbLpJdyTN https://t.co/p0CNLvx2yH<br />

Practicing jiujitsu CAN make one a deadly weapon - doesn't mean they will get there 😂 

It takes many years of training, and staying humble is critical

Arrogance prevents you from learning from your mistakes and getting better. 

Just look at russia as an example:)
