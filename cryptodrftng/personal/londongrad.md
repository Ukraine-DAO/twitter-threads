What a disgrace ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

But this is not the worst thing I've seen in London over the last few months. 

Starting a üßµ about the place that has been my home for the last few years - London AKA Londongrad.

Let's start from [@dhnnjyn](https://twitter.com/dhnnjyn) who has so much empathy in him that he couldn't see what's wrong with these horrendous posters from [@ONEintheUK](https://twitter.com/ONEintheUK). Whoever signed off these posters should resign, as well as [@dhnnjyn](https://twitter.com/dhnnjyn) himself. 

[@ONEintheUK](https://twitter.com/ONEintheUK), you need a reality check yourselves.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

    Well done @ONEintheUK for some hard-hitting posters in the heart of Westminster on the reality of #UKaid cuts. Let&#39;s hope policymakers pay heed https://t.co/xBYWrcF15f<br />

One of biggest genocide apologists in the West also resides here - [@jeremycorbyn](https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn) 

Despite being politically dead, this useful idiot has almost 2.5m Twitter followers. 

I'm not gonna lie - I hate this moron with a burning passion, wrote a whole üßµexplaining exactly why:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ Translation of @jeremycorbyn tweet:<br />
    <br />
    - I&#39;m strongly in favour of #GenocideOfUkrainians and am doing everything in my power for all Ukrainians to be killed<br />
    <br />
    - I mistakenly believe that because I suck up to a genocidal dictator he will spare me https://t.co/XSlO2ydRnD<br />

I'll carry on with London later, but let's expand a little and say hello to another genocide apologist [@PeterJHowson](https://twitter.com/PeterJHowson), senior lecturer of [@NorthumbriaUni](https://twitter.com/NorthumbriaUni) who writes for [@jacobin](https://twitter.com/jacobin) about "Ukraine's unfortunate neo-Nazi problem".

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

I deleted one of the tweets in that üßµ as it doesn't represent my views anymore. Instead sharing the message I sent to [@PeterJHowson](https://twitter.com/PeterJHowson) when he started tweeting me with nonsense YouTube videos, educating me, a RU speaker from Eastern üá∫üá¶ about the "Ukrainian Nazis" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
