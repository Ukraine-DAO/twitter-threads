I've been trying to tell people since 2014. Here is a slide from my presentation in 2015. Back then, it was a crazy accusation in üá¨üáß to say that üá∑üá∫ is becoming a fascist state. I was a 20yo from a rural area in Ukraine with no platform whatsoever. üßµ- [twitter.com/cryptodrftng/s‚Ä¶](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1499207267949977601?s=21&t=Zs_CbSFv2KNiZWyCDk1KHA)

I cried my eyes out tbh when I was reading this letter after the full scale invasion started. It was extremely sad for me to read it. This is the first open letter I ever published, I wasn't not a political activist and had like 300 Twitter followers before the 24th.

    6/ Open letter I published 3 days before the full-scale invasion. I&#39;d like to explain that what I meant here was that russia was making demands to NATO, not to Ukraine. <br />

    As a non-NATO member, Ukraine was unfortunately not able to tell russia to fuck off on NATO&#39;s behalf üíî https://t.co/SupAUwEzX2 https://t.co/lPKmctwIbc<br />

Insta stories from 22 Feb of "just a Twitter personality that only exists on Twitter". Unlike for some people, all of this is not a moral debate or an online argument. It's a fight for an existential threat that russia presents to everyone I love.

23 Feb 2022, Ukraine's Parliament channel ( [@verkhovna_rada](https://twitter.com/verkhovna_rada) ) - [www.instagram.com: Alona #SaveAzov #Íë≠ (@alona_ukrainedao) ‚Ä¢ Instagram photos and videos](https://www.instagram.com/p/CaVqIWFNaH_/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)

Not sure how I got there, my friend suggested me to them when they were looking for a Ukrainian protester from üá¨üáß

24 Feb 2022 - all Ukrainian news channels merged into one channel broadcasting fact-checked news 24/7: [www.instagram.com: Alona #SaveAzov #Íë≠ (@alona_ukrainedao) ‚Ä¢ Instagram photos and videos](https://www.instagram.com/p/CaYV5bONWL0/) 
It was awful to see the same hosts I knew, broadcasting from bomb shelters, some of them were crying, some swearing live. It's perfectly normal.

My friend said to me later that I was smiling too much for the first day of airstrikes but dad called me straight after this crying from happiness - that's what people in üá∫üá¶ wanted to see - Ukrainians smiling and big protests, to know that they're not alone.

It was also kinda my version of telling the russian warship to fuck off - we knew that the enemy is obviously watching that channel and that it wants to see us broken, crying, in panic. It was important to not give them that - they will be crying instead. [#StandWithUkraine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/StandWithUkraine)

This was mum's reaction on the 24th to the fact that we were invaded by the "second largest army in the world" (I have an alternative view of them - [twitter.com/cryptodrftng/s‚Ä¶](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1497421671959076873?s=21&t=M2wvrn8PTrXKIN5ngBy4FA))

Will share more about mum tomorrow, but here's my favourite recent quote from her:

This is what I posted on the night of the 24th. Obviously I was in a state of shock and angry that after all these years of üá∫üá¶ trying to tell the world about üá∑üá∫, we were not heard. Our experience was belittled and we were called russophobic Nazis: [www.instagram.com: Alona #SaveAzov #Íë≠ (@alona_ukrainedao) ‚Ä¢ Instagram photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/CaWVSBqNhkb/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)

In the post I left a link to [@BackAndAlive](https://twitter.com/BackAndAlive), here's a new one: [www.comebackalive.in.ua: Donate | comebackalive](https://www.comebackalive.in.ua/donate)

[@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) made the largest donation to Come Back Alive in its history because peace in Ukraine is only at this point possible through total military defeat of russia. [#ArmUkraineNow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArmUkraineNow)

    - What is the largest donation to @BackAndAlive?<br />
    - Probably $4m in crypto from @Ukraine_DAO. I don&#39;t remember others, tbh. There are some companies that frequently give smaller amounts, so their total amount may be larger.  But as a one-off, it&#39;s this one.<br />
