On the photo above: me in 2015 at the presentation about the war in üá∫üá¶ and russian propaganda. That was the first time I tried explaining to people that russia is turning into a fascist state, saw the confused faces and realised that we are fucked.

Sorry it's been longer than 8 years - here's a photo of me protesting in Brighton. I didn't have any Ukrainian friends who could join me so I made that placard and stood at Churchill Square on my own - because people back in Kyiv were fighting oppression.

It's June 2022 now. [@brokenpixelua](https://twitter.com/brokenpixelua) has to explain he is not a fascist member of far right militia and [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) is telling you about how russia is "exporting" grain from occupied territories. Have a great evening.

7 (?)/ This üßµ has a very incomplete list of people sending me abuse. 

[@StephenKolanko1](https://twitter.com/StephenKolanko1) for example thinks I should be grateful for not being in a filtration camp. 

"Protector of Ukraine" my ass
