In March 2020, just as the pandemic was hitting the UK where I'm based, I was diagnosed with [#type1diabetes](https://twitter.com/hashtag/type1diabetes) which is an incurable autoimmune disorder that requires extremely complex care. Exhausted rn but will later post about life with a disability in this üßµ  [twitter.com/NataliaHodgins‚Ä¶](https://twitter.com/NataliaHodgins/status/1532666873069744128)

I'll write up this üßµ about type 1 diabetes soon, I promise üòÖ

    Quite often when I feel EXTRA angry it&#39;s an indication that it&#39;s time for an insulin injection (one of my 5 to 10 daily ones). https://t.co/rFVq42yyhw<br />

Average life expectancy of people who have type 1 diabetes is shortened by over 20 years. 

That being said, I'm VERY grateful that it happened to me and I don't see it as a reason to feel sorry for me.

Attaching Insta stories from last year about living with it.

If you have type 1 diabetes, you don't know for sure whether you'll wake up when you go to bed. It's called "dead in bed (DIB) syndrome". 

Some people my age I know have died from it. That makes me feel grateful when I wake up - waking up is simply not guaranteed to me.

I almost always wear a glucose monitoring sensor, either [@dexcom](https://twitter.com/dexcom) or Libre. 

Unlike most people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the UK, I've never used an insulin pump - I manage fine without it. 

Before the 24th Feb I trained jiujitsu every day - not a good combo with pumps.

A very common misconception about Type 1 Diabetes is that I can't eat sugar.

‚ùóÔ∏èIn reality it's the opposite - if my blood sugar drops low and I don't have sugar immediately, it's very dangerous. 

I'd always prefer to leave the house without insulin to leaving without sugar.

Things people with Type 1 Diabetes DO NOT want to hear:

‚ùóÔ∏èunsolicited medical advice

‚ùóÔ∏èstories about all your relatives who died from diabetes but you're not sure what type they had 

‚ùóÔ∏è"Do you have the good type or the bad type?" (I personally have the gangsta type üî´)

Things people with T1D don't want to hear - Part II  

‚ÅâÔ∏è"You got it late, it can still pass." No it can't. And it takes you 3 seconds to look it up and not say ignorant BS to me.

‚ÅâÔ∏è"I could never do this." - I wasn't planning to either, for the first 26 years of my life.

For the love of god, avoid asking "What did you do to get it?"

‚ùåType 1 Diabetes is NOT a lifestyle disease. It's an autoimmune disorder.

I was training Brazilian jiujitsu and having a fairly healthy diet when I was diagnosed. It's not something I could've prevented.

On a related note - some Twitter Spaces hosts who've been abusive to me online tried to guilt trip me basically saying that the fact that they have autism / Asperger's gives them a carte blanche to be assholes.

I wrote a whole üßµ about why that is absolute nonsense üëá

Number of times I've weaponised my disability to justify being a bitch to people online is zero

Since the 24th Feb until now I've barely ever mentioned that I have a disability, but the bottom line is that I'm not the right person to be guiltripped with someone's Asperger's.

‚ú® Being diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes means a COMPLETE change of lifestyle, whatever your lifestyle is before you develop T1D. 

The first thing I asked the doctors at the hospital was "Will I still be able to train jiujitsu?!" 

Their response was "to train what, sorry?"üòπ

    2/ Tbh I&#39;m not even a huge fan of training boxing (I like watching it more üòÇ &#43; mostly trained Brazilian jiujitsu and not boxing) but Indija is fucking awesome: https://t.co/DNw24uSrdM <br />

I managed to get back into training quite soon after being diagnosed.

‚ùìDid it get much harder than it was before? Obviously. But it's not impossible. 

‚úÖ "Accept the diagnosis, don't accept the prognosis" is my attitude to both type 1 diabetes and the war in Ukraine.

    ‚ú®I trained Brazilian jiujitsu for over 2 years, almost every day before the full scale invasion started. I&#39;d often get up at 5am to go to a 7am class and then be at work on time by 9. <br />

    Hey @SarahAshtonLV,<br />

    They ask if I ate too much sugar<br />

[@gunittt12](https://twitter.com/gunittt12), take a look at 5/ of this üßµ

I have access to an insulin pump - not wearing one is a conscious decisionüôÇ

Before 24th Feb, I was managing Type 1 Diabetes so well that you wouldn't see it on A1C test I even had diabetes at all - it's a very rare level of control

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

    @cryptodrftng @SarahAshtonLV interesting that in 21st century insulin pump &#43; glucose sensor still are not in wide use<br />
