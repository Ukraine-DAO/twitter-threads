When I speak in various Twitter Spaces, there's often someone shouting at me within the first few minutes. I know what I'm talking about so I can speak confidently without having to scream. If you can't be more composed than me, your hurt feelings are not going to affect me.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    most young people are too agreeable<br />
    <br />
    and worse, most of their peers exacerbate the issue<br />
    <br />
    *truly* impressive people not only have their own original ideas &#43; opinions, but they know how to respectfully disagree &#43; hold their ground<br />

How to support Ukraine:
‚úÖ listening to Ukrainians

‚ùå teaching Ukrainians about russians
‚ùå telling us how we should feel and what's ok to say
‚ùå putting üá∫üá¶ in your username but hurling abuse at me 

It's not that hard. If that's not observed, I leave the conversation.
