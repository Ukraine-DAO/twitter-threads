My conversation from about 22 Feb with a friend who was understandably terrified.

‚ùóÔ∏èI was trying to tell people that russia was going to commit genocide for over 8 years. 

‚ùóÔ∏èWhen my parents were telling me to continue tell the truth, they realised what could happen to them.

I posted that conversation on my Instagram the same day. That post is still there - [www.instagram.com: Alona #SaveAzov #Íë≠ on Instagram: "On the next slide you will see the first conversation I started my day with. I know for a fact that Russian forces are creating lists of Ukrainians to be killed or sent to camps in the event of further occupation. I am certain that my family will be on that list bec](https://www.instagram.com/p/CaSi1KstFfu/)

The last few weeks before the invasion were nerve-wrecking to the extent I can't even explain - awful desperation of trying to tell everyone what was about to happen.

When I posted this, I had about 300 followers on Twitter. 

No one knew me. 

Ukraine DAO obviously wasn't a thing yet, even though social media accounts for it were already set up - just in case. 

But I already had people online telling me that Holodomor never happened.

I'm bullied online every single day 24/7, which I diligently document. 

Last time [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) happened, russians & co were not held accountable.

People have very short memory so I'm making sure that the way Ukrainians are treated rn is documented and remembered.

Since I said this on 22 Feb, nothing has changed. 

The real purpose of my work is to do everything I can to make sure that [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) never happens again. 

And I'm surprised by how many people have been outraged and offended by me doing this work.

In addition to the lists you see on Twitter and Notion, [#russianWarCrimes](https://twitter.com/hashtag/russianWarCrimes) are also now recorded on blockchain. 

üîê Which means no one will be able to tamper with that data or challenge its authenticity. Some of it is already with [@IntlCrimCourt](https://twitter.com/IntlCrimCourt).

We need to hold ruSSians accountable for their actions 

üö®Whenever you see a "good ruSSian" bleating about how they're being discriminated against during [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) - that's NOT a "good ruSSian" ü¶Ñ

How many times do I have to explain this basic thing?

    &#34;I think a fundamental mistake was made after the Second World War. While the Nazi crimes were widely condemned, the communists crimes never were. So we see a strong revival of Stalinism right now in Russia<br />
