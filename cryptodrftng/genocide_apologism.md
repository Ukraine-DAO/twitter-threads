New entry on the list of genocide apologists: [@PeterCorless](https://twitter.com/PeterCorless) 
- Randomly had a go at me on Twitter defending [@ICRC](https://twitter.com/ICRC)
- Strange personal insults followed 

I was wondering what his views were.

Turns out he finds the comparison of Hitler's and Stalin's regimes "idiotic", praising "workers collective farms". 

It is estimated that the Holocaust took lives of about 6 million Jewish people.

The Holodomor carried out by Soviets killed up to 5 million Ukrainians.

    Thank you, @Ry5i0 for saying something that should be obvious to anyone. <br />

    I never paid attention before to what @PeterCorless was saying on Twitter but today I came across this, and that tells me everything I needed to know. https://t.co/TnyPFxsr0q https://t.co/PgrPCak35N<br />

And the moment I pointed this out, I got blocked.

[@PeterCorless](https://twitter.com/PeterCorless) is literally a genocide apologist. If you follow him, please keep that in mind.

    &#34;I am no apologist to Stalin, BUT...&#34; &lt;--- awful take. It is very discouraging to see statements like this. But on the other hand, it gives perspective to other comments he has said. https://t.co/wV8tyDzTGH<br />
