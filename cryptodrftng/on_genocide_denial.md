There is a reason why Holocaust denial is a taboo & a criminal offence in many countries. It's not a "violation of freedom of speech", is it? 
Publicly saying that üá∫üá¶ should cede territory to russia should be a taboo too. Whoever says it should be deeply ashamed of themselves.

    During the removal of debris from one plant in #Mariupol, ~70 dead people were found. The bodies were packed in plastic bags &amp; taken away for burial in a mass grave in the village of Old Crimea. Identification wasn&#39;t carried out, eyewitnesses said it&#39;s impossible<br />

Hello [@jacobin](https://twitter.com/jacobin), good morning! 

[@NorthumbriaUni](https://twitter.com/NorthumbriaUni) have you guys dismissed your genocide apologist [@PeterJHowson](https://twitter.com/PeterJHowson)? Are students still paying ¬£9k/year to listen to his nonsense?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ Today I&#39;ve been sent an article that mentions #Ukraine, @Ukraine_DAO and myself. <br />
    I&#39;d like to publicly address its author @PeterJHowson - a senior lecturer at @NorthumbriaUni. I recommend him to retract the article and publish an apology to @Ukraineüßµüá∫üá¶<br />

    @ChristopherJM has Ukrainian blood on his hands. <br />
