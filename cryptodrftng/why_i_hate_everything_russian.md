Hey [@NikaMelkozerova](https://twitter.com/NikaMelkozerova), making you a whole üßµ about why I hate everything russian as a russian speaker born and raised in Eastern Ukraine, why Ukrainians have the right to hate and why no one has the right to lecture us about how we should feel. I hope you find it helpful.

It's probably good to start from quoting a teacher from [#Kharkiv](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Kharkiv) 
"I taught russian language and literature. ...I instilled love for the üá∑üá∫ language and literature. I‚Äôd love for those liberators to see what they liberated us from. From now on we will have nothing russian."

People who have the nerve to be telling Ukrainians how we shouldn't be so angry and "hateful" - please work on your emotional intelligence, empathy and humility. In the meantime - please shut the fuck up.

People who tell me I "make things worse" and "giving them bullets" - I don't need to say or do anything for russians to hate us. I can't make it any worse - the worst is already happening. Imagine that ü§Ø

Check out this üßµ to find out what happened recently when I said that right now, when I meet a üá∑üá∫ person I don't know, they're "guity until proven innocent".

Yes, they are responsible on both collective and individual level. I know, the sense of personal responsibility is a completely alien concept to most russians, most Germans, most French people from what I see and in general to many people in this world.
