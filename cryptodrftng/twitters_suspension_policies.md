BTW, this wasn't the first time I went to Twitter jail ü™Ñ

üö®I don't know who needs to hear this, but hating the people responsible for the genocide of your nation and for the fact your home is getting shelled is not "hateful conduct".

‚ùóÔ∏èIt's a normal, healthy reaction.

    1/ I&#39;m back and would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest apologies to @Twitter for violating its rules by not being quiet about #GenocideOfUkrainians. Super sorry, @TwitterSupport, definitely will happen again - you can just remove my account if that&#39;s not cool.<br />

At least this time I could tell what got me banned - last time in April they didn't even refer to any particular content, it was just a shadow ban followed by a 1 week full ban:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    If I violated @Twitter rules - ok, fine. But it shouldn&#39;t be that hard to let me know in the notification which particular content @TwitterSupport found in violation of those rules, no? It would make a lot of sense, otherwise how do I know what not to post? @TwitterFaith https://t.co/q1w5hOLaVM<br />

Anyway:

‚ú®Twitter sucks

‚ú®decentralized social media is the way

‚ú® thank you to [@rizzn](https://twitter.com/rizzn) of our Dev Pod for setting up [masto.ukrainedao.love: UkraineDAO!](http://masto.ukrainedao.love)

[@joinmastodon](https://twitter.com/joinmastodon) can be set up to automatically cross-post everything you post on Twitter

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ I know what you mean, have been suspended for no apparent reason before. Backup of everything I post is at https://t.co/L3NKHUKPmA<br />
    <br />
    If it&#39;s too extreme for Twitter to say Ukrainians have the right to hate people who are killing us in our homes - I don&#39;t mind being suspended. https://t.co/oozZWDpTGs<br />
