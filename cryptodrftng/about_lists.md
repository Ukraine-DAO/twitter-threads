My friend: -Are [your family] in Ukraine?
Me: -Of course.
-Mum says Russians are making kill lists

-Well that‚Äôs bad. She tells me not to post anything online.

-I don‚Äôt know what to do!
-Mine are asking to tell everyone about what‚Äôs happening.

My post from 22 Feb 2022: "If you or someone in your family have ever experienced racism, sexism, homophobia, abuse, violence, discrimination or opression of any kind - you have to show solidarity to Ukraine."

Another post from 22 Feb 2022. I am making lists indeed, [@NovelSci](https://twitter.com/NovelSci) üôÉ I've been making for years. Good luck to all the genocide apologists - [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters), [@jacobin](https://twitter.com/jacobin), [@nytimes](https://twitter.com/nytimes) and many others. All of them will hear from us.
