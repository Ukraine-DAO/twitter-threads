There has been another attempt by the 🇷🇺 "anti-war" "feminists" from Pussy Riot and their friends to undermine me and other Ukrainians within [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) 

Absolute lack of empathy, arrogance, and hurt diva egos that I honestly couldn't care less about.

    ❗️I know,  the 🇷🇺 fake ass feminists are furious over me calling them out and I know everything they are doing to go after me.<br />

    ❗️They may be v famous and whatever but I have an advantage they don&#39;t have - I&#39;m right. And I happen to them a bit less dumb. Sorry, Nadya. https://t.co/QtWlfTpd40<br />

Expect info attacks on me and Ukraine DAO and other typical 🇷🇺 stuff. 

Saying this for transparency and so that everyone knows what to expect from these "Ukraine supporters".

The russian warship is going in the usual direction.

    50/ I&#39;ve been getting loads of abuse online. It&#39;s important to publicise this - what happens to me is basically Ukraine on a mini-scale. <br />
    <br />
    BTW, here&#39;s what Nadya of @pussyrrriot was concerned about in March, during genocide - 🇷🇺 world domination. This is sickening, not &#34;cute&#34;. https://t.co/8vWTUCsPFd https://t.co/54K0Ko9T9J<br />
