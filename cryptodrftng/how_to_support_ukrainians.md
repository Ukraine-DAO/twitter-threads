Received a lot of DMs asking for examples of things I've been told by abusive people.

Here is a good example. Not a single time do I raise my voice or lose composure in any way. 

After this incident, my team and I were harassed online by a whole group of people for weeks.

    This conversation happened in Twitter Spaces a couple days ago in front of 400 people. Sharing so it&#39;s easier to understand what I have to deal with every other day. <br />

📚 I keep a (still very incomplete) list of things that I've been called lately 

Most of the abusive people/accounts claim to support Ukraine.

❓If what happens on social media "doesn't matter", why is 🇷🇺 pumping so much money and effort into it?

In this 🧵 - a bit of my personal history in relation to 🇺🇦

I didn't come out of nowhere after finding Ukraine on the map 4 months ago - my life is completely, to its core, consumed by this war. I do my work in pubic with my name and face out there



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    ✨The biggest struggle for me has been people not hearing what I say<br />
    <br />
    ✨For a number of reasons (arrogance, ignorance, I&#39;m a girl) they make a false assumption that I&#39;m as stupid as them and so present no danger<br />
    <br />
    To illustrate - my post from 25 Jan, weeks before the invasion https://t.co/3a2mWCeYBm<br />

❌ Asking a Ukrainian to ignore abuse - appeasement politics on the mini scale

❓If your friend tells you that some abusive idiot keeps following her everywhere trying to beat her up, do you tell her to ignore it or to call the police?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    57/ @Louide 💞 I&#39;ll never back down to bullies as a Ukrainian - unlike russians, we actually practice what we preach 😂 <br />
    <br />
    I also got this message from a friend recently so it&#39;s also for him. I know he&#39;s watching ❤️ https://t.co/X7K1GJl7oe https://t.co/iZAk5GEywc<br />

Both people hosting spaces and listeners may find this🧵 helpful - written after someone told me I can't be upset about being abused by an autistic host. 

I have a disability much more devastating. 
My view - that guy shouldn't be a host for UA spaces

If you want to find out what it's like to be a Ukrainian person  (or at least myself) - 🧵 here:

Here's a 🧵 debunking an article that depicts me as a crypto scammer, disaster capitalist etc - its author has blocked me because he knows I'll take him to court when I have time for that kind of stuff after Ukraine's victory.



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ Today I&#39;ve been sent an article that mentions #Ukraine, @Ukraine_DAO and myself. <br />
    I&#39;d like to publicly address its author @PeterJHowson - a senior lecturer at @NorthumbriaUni. I recommend him to retract the article and publish an apology to @Ukraine🧵🇺🇦<br />

Here's continuation of the 🧵 (it breaks down because I deleted tweet 6 which doesn't reflect my views on Pussy Riot anymore).

❗️My current views about 🇷🇺 "anti-war feminists" who turned [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) in a Pussyverse ad - here: [twitter.com/cryptodrftng/s…](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1547239222565806081?s=21&t=rZmty7MHXLsPV27vAoXmzQ)

BTW, Pussy Riot now deleted the tweets with their false accusations of me mismanaging funds of [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) after the community spoke up overwhelmingly in my favour. 

Thanks to blockchain it's easily verifiable that they lied, so I'm actually waiting for public apologies.

For those who say me I shouldn't focus on the negative - I actually have a 🧵 with the loving messages people send to me.

It's much longer than the negative ones - and much more incomplete ❤️ Grateful for all the support, sending love to everyone (excepts russians 😈)

    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ Starting 🧵 for the kind messages I get every day. I believe they&#39;re addressed to all Ukrainian people - my struggles are nothing compared to what Ukrainians on the ground in the warzone have been through. I hope all this warm energy cheers them up too ❤️<br />

Forgot to add the tweet about me being in the UK

I'm going to be wherever I want to be and so is every other Ukrainian person.

To be accusing a Ukrainian of not being under airstrikes, you have to be sick in your head.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

    ❗️Ukrainians abroad often experience extreme grief and deserve empathy. <br />
    <br />
    @osint88 has shown none of it, trying to guilttrip and belittle me<br />

Re "🇷🇺 agent/honeypot" accusations ✨
-
Some people found me on twitter just a few days ago but I've been doing all of this for many years: 
[twitter.com/cryptodrftng/s…](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1505429104572653568)

All 🇺🇦 comms specialists I spoke to approve of my work so dw about me "harming 🇺🇦"- its russians who harm it

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    A message from &#34;claimed founder of Ukraine DAO that only exists on Twitter&#34;<br />
    Recorded in a language that this &#34;supporter of 🇺🇦&#34; doesn&#39;t understand because he only found 🇺🇦 on the map a few months ago, but TLDR:<br />
    <br />
    if I&#39;m a russian agent, other russian agents should be like me😂❤️ https://t.co/MnOeESZBYA https://t.co/tw0GTFWfAz<br />
