Azov recently discovered the work I’ve been doing to defend them in the info space. 

❗️Info attacks on them have been so consistent that a lot of projects at this point are scared to alienate the part of the Western audience ignorant about them.

    One of my favourite things about my visit to Ukraine was meeting Azov representatives. <br />
    <br />
    Olena and Nikita are absolutely amazing and I can&#39;t imagine what they&#39;ve been going through with constant 🇷🇺 info attacks - on top of all the grief ❤️‍🩹<br />

✨I am proud to support Azov ✨

❗️As someone who grew up in Eastern Ukraine and used to speak russian a lot (which I now deeply regret, BTW), I’m not scared of Azov, lol.

I love them, Ukrainian 🏳️‍🌈  community loves them and so should you ❤️

❗️Please don’t try to educate me about Azov with Russia Today links 😂 

❗️Wikipedia is not a reliable source of information either 😉 [#SaveAzov](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaveAzov) [#ꑭ](https://twitter.com/hashtag/%EA%91%AD)

    Quick question for the dudes on Twitter who try to educate Ukrainians about Ukraine with a Wikipedia link and a 🇷🇺-sponsored YouTube video (99,9% of them haven&#39;t been to 🇺🇦):<br />
    <br />
    Do you realise exactly how fucking stupid you look? #AskingForAFriend<br />

✨For the folks in the back:

❗️persecution of russian speakers in 🇺🇦 does not exist

❗️speaking russian doesn't make you pro-russian

❗️Dnipro was a largely russian-speaking city before 🇷🇺 Nazis came

Good luck trying to tell russian speakers there that you liked russia 👋

    This is always the first question I ask the &#34;experts&#34; bleating about &#34;Ukrainian Nazis&#34; (🦄)<br />
    <br />
    ❌ Claim: <br />
    <br />
    &#34;🇺🇦 Nazis&#34; (🦄) are persecuting RU speakers in Eastern 🇺🇦&#34;<br />
    <br />
    That RU speaker is me.<br />
    <br />
    Do these idiots think they&#39;ll educate me about 🇺🇦 with a YouTube video and an RT article? https://t.co/38BqMErvxd<br />

    A russian speaker from Eastern Ukraine, for some reason I spend every day &amp; night trying to help Ukraine&#39;s defenders save 🇺🇦 from the 🇷🇺 Nazis. But it&#39;s not the ruscists &amp; #GenocideOfUkrainians that bother lots of people, it&#39;s Azov&#39;s symbols they&#39;re ignorant about.<br />
