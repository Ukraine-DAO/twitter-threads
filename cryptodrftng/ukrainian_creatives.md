Starting a 🧵 about 🇺🇦 creatives

On the photo by [@brokenpixelua](https://twitter.com/brokenpixelua) - a well known 🇺🇦 film producer Volodymyr Yatsenko

📝Article featuring him: [www.screendaily.com: Ukrainian filmmakers and execs put down cameras and pick up guns ...](https://www.screendaily.com/news/ukrainian-filmmakers-and-execs-put-down-cameras-and-pick-up-guns-in-fight-for-their-country/5168091.article)

🕊«Make art not war» is a beautiful slogan - and an option that many 🇺🇦 artists do not have.

Oleg Sentsov spent 5 (!) years in a 🇷🇺 on fabricated terrorism charges. I can’t explain to you how much effort went into his release - 🇷🇺 were effectively holding him as hostage because they know that 🇺🇦 care about each other. They’ve now kidnapped 1.2m Ukrainians like that.

I never thought he would have to go through hell again after what he’s been through, but here we are.

BTW, linking a [@KyivPost](https://twitter.com/KyivPost) article below but please approach them with caution - will talk about them on another occasion.
