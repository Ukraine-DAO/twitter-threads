[@maksymeristavi](https://twitter.com/maksymeristavi) I answered the question recently about when russia will get over its homophobia - I think it's scheduled for the same day when russia ends. 

Does my forecast sound right to you?

    1/ They&#39;ll never get over it because it&#39;s the core of &#34;russian culture&#34; and it&#39;s the same thing that makes them attack Ukraine:<br />
    <br />
    &#34;My life is shit but instead of trying to make it better I&#39;m gonna go ruin someone else&#39;s to make me feel less miserable.&#34; https://t.co/w0MCmZFKUw<br />

Can't help but say hello to all the fake "feminists" and "LGBT activists" out there. 

Here's a list with a lot of them, in that "anti-war manifesto" they wrote: [twitter.com/mariamposts/st‚Ä¶](https://twitter.com/mariamposts/status/1522502618693750786?s=21&t=R2RMJImnL-wBW0XccuVvuA)

I'm collecting their publicity available contact details - would love to chat to them.

    Can we also add here the &#34;feminists&#34; and &#34;LGBT activists&#34; who advocate for &#34;peaceful negotiations&#34; with russia. <br />
    <br />
    They should travel to moscow and stand there for 5 min with an anti-war placard üïä<br />

Core messages of the russian "culture":

1. My life is shit.

2. Instead of trying to make it better, I'm gonna go ruin someone else's life to make me feel less miserable.

    @cryptodrftng @maksymeristavi This is probably what confounds me most about russia. With the biggest country on earth, and what appears to be abundant resources, they could have an amazing quality of life. Instead they choose to fuck other people over???<br />
