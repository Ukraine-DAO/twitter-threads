# Each of us has been in agony from 1000s propaganda cuts

Ukrainians don't complain much but I hope they don't mind me saying this: I speak 4 languages and none of them has words that can describe how much it hurts to be one of us these days. 

Each of us has been in agony from 1000s propaganda cuts. Literally, lie on a lie on a lie.

The injustice of it goes beyond most things that have happened in the human history before. 

I don't understand how we manage to even survive, let alone deal with all this with so much dignity and class. It's  superhuman resilience we are showing for the last 87 days.

We are literally going through a genocide and in the meantime I watch my friends worrying every day about how to communicate this to some of our "allies" without upsetting/stressing them too much. We think about their feelings (!)

We do that while they are paying for us to be killed. 
I barely left the house the last 3 months and today I went for a walk. It was sunny, and I thought of every Ukrainian person who'll never see sunlight again - or anything else. Because they were killed for being Ukrainian.

My friends found me crying my eyes out in the park and forced me to take a tranquiliser. I went home and probably won't leave for the next week or so. That's the trauma I have after spending 0 (!) days in the warzone. 

Imagine what Ukrainians from these photos went through?

These are my main academic qualifications. I'm also a qualified translator: [Member check | CIOL (Chartered Institute of Linguists)](https://www.ciol.org.uk/member-check/profile/55926/17673)

You know what I have to do every day? Begging for heavy weapons everywhere I can so that my family survives this and I can see them again. Is this normal?

There are no more Mondays, weekends, no days of the week in my life. It's been one long limbo I'm stuck in until this ends, because it's a matter of life and death. 

I'll never forgive myself if looking back at this time I'll think "there was something else I could've done".

Patriotism of Ukrainians is not some unhealthy attachment to a piece of land. 
That land has pretty much everything and everyone we love. 
Would you not fight for it if you were us? It's not even as much heroism as it's self-preservation instinct.

We have every right to be angry and to hate (!) the people, countries and organisations responsible for this war. We won't ever be blinded by hatred like russians are right now - for no reason. We don't have it in us. So fuck off if you're worrying about "russophobia".

Next time you see someone defending russian culture, remember that once of the primary aims of it is erasing Ukrainians and everything Ukrainian out of existence. Most "great russian artists" are Ukrainians/people of other ethnicities appropriated by russians.
