This has to be heard by everyone. 

🇷🇺 sends to 🇺🇦 the people whose deaths it doesn't mind - in 🇷🇺 culture that's pretty much anyone. They don't value human life.

Meanwhile, 🇺🇦 sacrifices its most precious people. We lost [@ratushnyi_r](https://twitter.com/ratushnyi_r) a few days ago.

    7 guys from our unit was injured last week on a front line. Two of them lost their legs. That’s unbelievable no one was killed. And they don’t even saw their enemies <br />

[@brokenpixelua](https://twitter.com/brokenpixelua) is one of the most intelligent and well-read people I've met - and I know a lot of people. 

He'd rather be making films instead of shooting. 

All the Ukrainians fighting the ruscist occupants would rather be doing something very different now.

We literally don't have a choice. 

🇺🇦 Defenders should have an unlimited supply of weapons - the West has enough in stock to provide it. 

Arm them better and faster so that you don't have to arm yourself:

That's Volodymyr's unit in the [@CNN](https://twitter.com/CNN) video by [@bencnn](https://twitter.com/bencnn) 

Meanwhile, 🇷🇺 is pumping more oil to Europe than it was before the war:

    Ukrainians say they only have 10% of the weapons they’ve asked for from the West. Soldiers training for battle on the front lines tell CNN they need bigger weapons now @bencnn reports https://t.co/ofSzW8YKK2<br />
