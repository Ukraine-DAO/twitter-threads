Over the last 100+ days, I've had all sorts of breakdowns and I'm extremely mentally stable person.
I've stared at the wall all day (before the invasion, afterwards I didn't have the time)
I've cried for hours.
I've told close friends I don't want to be in this world anymore.

    With everything I‚Äôve been through in the last several months, tonight is the first time I‚Äôve cried. I can‚Äôt understand why this is able to go on without help. Why the world at large can‚Äôt put political shit aside and see its a responsibility of humans to stop this. How many more?<br />

When that happened, it wasn't me wanting to go and do something to myself - I cherish life at pretty much any moment and grateful for being alive. But I watched [@Bundeskanzler](https://twitter.com/Bundeskanzler) worry about recession. [@EmmanuelMacron](https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron) - about not saving putin's face. After Bucha.

[#russianWarCrimes](https://twitter.com/hashtag/russianWarCrimes) no matter how awful they are, are not the most scary thing in the world to me. You know what is? Human apathy. "Neutrality". Watching millions of human beings who are just like me, go through unspeakable suffering & saying "yes but what about Azov's symbols?"

    1/ Perfect tweet to start an educationalüßµ about russia from. <br />

    Remember - if you don&#39;t hate russia, you just don&#39;t know it well enough ‚úä <br />
    But I&#39;ll fix that üíÉ https://t.co/7uxbwNQWf1<br />

    After all the indescribable suffering that russia has inflicted on Ukraine, if it&#39;s still the &#34;Ukrainian Nazis&#34; that concern you and you&#39;re worried about safety of russians who are &#34;not to blame&#34; - you&#39;re sick in your head. <br />
    <br />
    Ukrainians shouldn&#39;t have to listen to this bullshit.<br />

    1/ Ukrainians don&#39;t complain much but I hope they don&#39;t mind me saying this: I speak 4 languages and none of them has words that can describe how much it hurts to be one of us these days. <br />
    <br />
    Each of us has been in agony from 1000s propaganda cuts. Literally, lie on a lie on a lie.<br />

Today is mum's birthday. The only thing I really wish is for her to simply be alive by the same day next year.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ Just called mum. <br />
    &#34;I still can&#39;t believe that all of this is real. <br />
    <br />
    That the world is watching it and letting it happen to us. <br />
    <br />
    It&#39;s like we&#39;re in the 40s of the last century again, but this time everyone can see it real time. How is this even possible?&#34;<br />

    When I was a child, I&#39;d read books about the Holodomor and could never understand how the world let that happen to Ukrainians.

As this is happening, I'm the one who's called hateful, clickbaiter, disaster capitalist. My parents are now effectively refugees, displaced within the country. There is a filtration camp 50km from my home town. People online tell me I should be thankful I'm not there. –î—è–∫—É—é.

    9/ We have every right to be angry and to hate (!) the people, countries and organisations responsible for this war. We won&#39;t ever be blinded by hatred like russians are right now - for no reason. We don&#39;t have it in us. So fuck off if you&#39;re worrying about &#34;russophobia&#34;. https://t.co/fOR99emyYg<br />

As any self-respecting Ukrainian Nazi, at the worst moments I reached out for support to a russian-born friend (he hates russia too, btw). He replied with the most unexpected and the most reassuring thing: "Of course you don't want to live anymore. It's absolutely normal."

It's normal to not want to be in this world anymore. You accept that state, wait for it to pass, it passes, then comes back again. At some point in was a daily thing. It was often some of [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) contributors who learned to pick up on when I'm in that state.

They learned how to drag me out of that dark place in my mind. You know, there is this aphorism by Nietzsche - "what doesn‚Äôt kill you, makes you stronger".

As a üá∫üá¶ person, you often sit down and think "how much stronger do I need to become? At what point do I die from pain?
