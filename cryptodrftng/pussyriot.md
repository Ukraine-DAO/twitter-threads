Wow. I've been purposefully avoiding talking about [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) publicly but I guess I haven't been left with a choice (no pun intended, [@TheChoiceDAO](https://twitter.com/TheChoiceDAO)) 

In this üßµ I'll address why they have a problem with me.

Before I start:

‚ú® Ukraine DAO works with the support of the Ukrainian government, namely [@mintsyfra](https://twitter.com/mintsyfra) and [@abornyakov](https://twitter.com/abornyakov).

‚ú® We have had zero complaints from the Ukrainian government about how we manage our funds. 

[business.diia.gov.ua: Verified Ukraine Donations List](https://business.diia.gov.ua/cases/novini/verified-ukraine-donations-list)

This is a chat from which Ukraine DAO started. I only added [@DefiHope](https://twitter.com/DefiHope) and [@zencephalon](https://twitter.com/zencephalon) there at first and didn't think much of it. 

By that time, I'd spent weeks trying to get through the mental breakdown that was caused by me trying to tell people what was about to happen.

This is what I said to [@zencephalon](https://twitter.com/zencephalon) 4 days before the full scale invasion started. Sharing with his permission. 

I kept telling people that something awful was about to happen and pretty much everyone was laughing at me, except for other Ukrainians and [@FreeRossDAO](https://twitter.com/FreeRossDAO) team.

[@FreeRossDAO](https://twitter.com/FreeRossDAO) team was also kind enough to accomidate me publishing the only open letter I ever wrote - it was about the imminent war in Ukraine.

[@RJPinnell](https://twitter.com/RJPinnell) [@rizzn](https://twitter.com/rizzn) [@Schlomo](https://twitter.com/Schlomo) [@FreeJeremyNet](https://twitter.com/FreeJeremyNet) & others are forever family - helped me through the darkest days

My messages with [@zencephalon](https://twitter.com/zencephalon) from 22 Feb 2022, 2 days before the invasion. This is what was going through my mind.

One of the reasons [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) decided to go after me is the same reason russia thought it was a good idea to invade Ukraine:
‚ú®russians are ignorant about Ukrainians ‚ú®

Pussy Riot ladies had no idea who I am and what I've been doing when they blasted off that silly tweet üòÇ

On the 24th in the middle of the night I told [@DefiHope](https://twitter.com/DefiHope) and [@zencephalon](https://twitter.com/zencephalon) what was happening. I was in too much of a shock to think about DAOs and went to the protest at 10 Downing st. 

The story of Ukraine DAO by [@itstaylorlocke](https://twitter.com/itstaylorlocke) for [@FortuneMagazine](https://twitter.com/FortuneMagazine): [finance.yahoo.com: Ethereum‚Äôs Russian-born cofounder has been quietly supporting a DAO that raised $8 million in crypto for Ukraine. His dad is even more involved.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-russian-born-cofounder-quietly-183929743.html)

The "scandalous" information about me being paid, I've actually been telling journalists about it. whenever an opportunity presented itself. 

[@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) would know this if they read one of my interviews, and were not so obsessed with their own ones.

Interrupting our broadcast for ‚ö°Ô∏èBREAKING NEWS - A UKRAINIAN FEMALE WHO WORKS FOR DEFENCE OF üá∫üá¶ AROUND THE CLOCK, GETS PAID BY THE DAO SHE STARTED ‚ö°Ô∏è

That's something that a üá∑üá∫ "feminist" collective can't tolerate ü§¨

Tough pill to swallow!

Very pro-üá∫üá¶:)
Very feminist:)) [twitter.com/pussyrrriot/st‚Ä¶](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot/status/1540782404813475841)

So on the night of the 24th, [@DefiHope](https://twitter.com/DefiHope) and [@zencephalon](https://twitter.com/zencephalon) started pulling their friends into the group chat.

Unfortunately, one of them was Nadya Tolokonnikova of [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot). 

üí°Fun fact: the technique Nadya used today is called DARVO, look it up.

| [![](/media/1573584299319754753/3_1540787975860080640.jpg)](/media/1573584299319754753/3_1540787975860080640.jpg) |
| :-: |

üìñ DARVO - Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender.

üß† Very effective thing that russians do very often, it uses cognitive bias - the first thing you hear is remembered and believed in disproportionately.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

What was a disaster of a lifetime to me, Nadya saw as a PR-opportunity. If you google "Ukraine DAO Pussy Riot", you will see how many interviews she gave on our behalf. I dare you to find a single article where she mentions my involvement - or that of any other üá∫üá¶ person.

Now, THIS is actually a fucking pisstake. 

To turn [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) into a "Pussyverse" ad - you have to be messed up on another level.

You didn't start [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) with a number of friends, Nadya.

I started it on 21 Feb with my friends. 

A üá∫üá¶ person, not r*ssian.

| :-: |

My name was removed from press releases even after I repeatedly added it there myself and [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) claimed to all the journalists that they started this DAO - no mention of Ukrainian people or their efforts. 
What-so-ever üôÉ
Instead, they did this: [pic.twitter.com/vvCXMlTj9S](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1540796950320074755/video/1)

| :-: |

The reason why all of this is very important to talk about is not due to some egoistic pettiness:

‚ú®There is a pattern in üá∫üá¶ history whereby russians, even the ones who claim to be in opposition, take credit for the work/art of Ukrainians. 

‚ú® It's part of their culture.

After the distribution of funds in the early March, Nadya leaves the project (info on who now manages funds - here: [ukraine-dao.notion.site: Multisig & Treasury - UkraineDAO.eth](https://ukraine-dao.notion.site/Multisig-Treasury-UkraineDAO-eth-b080b59f794848fa8f6ac1b22575792c) ) 

‚ö°Ô∏èWeeks later, with no prior notice, she storms into the UKD chat that has about 150 people, infuriatied by this tweet about [@ICRC](https://twitter.com/ICRC)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

üßµ about the Red Cross, [@ICRC](https://twitter.com/ICRC) in particular - here.

üìñ TLDR - they're legitimizing r*ssia and assist r*ssia with forceful deportation of Ukrainians.

Storming into the chat Nadya didn't into account 2 things:

1Ô∏è‚É£ how much work I was doing non-stop while she was giving interviews 

2Ô∏è‚É£ I do not give a fuck how famous someone is so this diva behaviour doesn't work with meüòÇ

| :-: |

After being told by other [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) contributors to go in the direction of the russian warship, Nadya disappeared. I recently reached out to her friend  to ask Nadya to stop presenting herself as a co-founder & using our cause for hype - radio silence. 
Reminds me of this:

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I do not know how much money Pussy Riot made from all the concerts where they're waving the üá∫üá¶ flag.

üôÉ Equally, I don't deserve for anyone to be mad at me for being able to cover my rent.

The situation is very simple:

‚úÖ russians (Pussy Riot) have the right to use the war in Ukraine for hype.

‚úÖ A Ukrainian person should be sad, miserable and live on the street, if live at all.

Got this [@decrypt](https://twitter.com/decrypt) headline in my inbox this morning - I receive alerts when [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) is mentioned in the media. The article features a photo of Nadya from [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) at a peace march in support of Ukraine - the country she doesn't care about.

I've been getting loads of abuse online. It's important to publicise this - what happens to me is basically Ukraine on a mini-scale.
