Wow. I've been purposefully avoiding talking about [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) publicly but I guess I haven't been left with a choice (no pun intended, [@TheChoiceDAO](https://twitter.com/TheChoiceDAO)) 

In this 🧵 I'll address why they have a problem with me.

Before I start:

✨ Ukraine DAO works with the support of the Ukrainian government, namely [@mintsyfra](https://twitter.com/mintsyfra) and [@abornyakov](https://twitter.com/abornyakov).

✨ We have had zero complaints from the Ukrainian government about how we manage our funds. 

[business.diia.gov.ua: Verified Ukraine Donations List](https://business.diia.gov.ua/cases/novini/verified-ukraine-donations-list)

This is a chat from which Ukraine DAO started. I only added [@DefiHope](https://twitter.com/DefiHope) and [@zencephalon](https://twitter.com/zencephalon) there at first and didn't think much of it. 

By that time, I'd spent weeks trying to get through the mental breakdown that was caused by me trying to tell people what was about to happen.

This is what I said to [@zencephalon](https://twitter.com/zencephalon) 4 days before the full scale invasion started. Sharing with his permission. 

I kept telling people that something awful was about to happen and pretty much everyone was laughing at me, except for other Ukrainians and [@FreeRossDAO](https://twitter.com/FreeRossDAO) team.

[@FreeRossDAO](https://twitter.com/FreeRossDAO) team was also kind enough to accomidate me publishing the only open letter I ever wrote - it was about the imminent war in Ukraine.

[@RJPinnell](https://twitter.com/RJPinnell) [@rizzn](https://twitter.com/rizzn) [@Schlomo](https://twitter.com/Schlomo) [@FreeJeremyNet](https://twitter.com/FreeJeremyNet) & others are forever family - helped me through the darkest days

My messages with [@zencephalon](https://twitter.com/zencephalon) from 22 Feb 2022, 2 days before the invasion. This is what was going through my mind.

One of the reasons [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) decided to go after me is the same reason russia thought it was a good idea to invade Ukraine:
✨russians are ignorant about Ukrainians ✨

Pussy Riot ladies had no idea who I am and what I've been doing when they blasted off that silly tweet 😂

On the 24th in the middle of the night I told [@DefiHope](https://twitter.com/DefiHope) and [@zencephalon](https://twitter.com/zencephalon) what was happening. I was in too much of a shock to think about DAOs and went to the protest at 10 Downing st. 

The story of Ukraine DAO by [@itstaylorlocke](https://twitter.com/itstaylorlocke) for [@FortuneMagazine](https://twitter.com/FortuneMagazine): [finance.yahoo.com: Ethereum’s Russian-born cofounder has been quietly supporting a DAO that raised $8 million in crypto for Ukraine. His dad is even more involved.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-russian-born-cofounder-quietly-183929743.html)

The "scandalous" information about me being paid, I've actually been telling journalists about it. whenever an opportunity presented itself. 

[@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) would know this if they read one of my interviews, and were not so obsessed with their own ones.

Interrupting our broadcast for ⚡️BREAKING NEWS - A UKRAINIAN FEMALE WHO WORKS FOR DEFENCE OF 🇺🇦 AROUND THE CLOCK, GETS PAID BY THE DAO SHE STARTED ⚡️

That's something that a 🇷🇺 "feminist" collective can't tolerate 🤬

Tough pill to swallow!

Very pro-🇺🇦:)
Very feminist:)) [twitter.com/pussyrrriot/st…](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot/status/1540782404813475841)

So on the night of the 24th, [@DefiHope](https://twitter.com/DefiHope) and [@zencephalon](https://twitter.com/zencephalon) started pulling their friends into the group chat.

Unfortunately, one of them was Nadya Tolokonnikova of [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot). 

💡Fun fact: the technique Nadya used today is called DARVO, look it up.

| [![](/media/1573584299319754753/3_1540787975860080640.jpg)](/media/1573584299319754753/3_1540787975860080640.jpg) |

📖 DARVO - Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender.

🧠 Very effective thing that russians do very often, it uses cognitive bias - the first thing you hear is remembered and believed in disproportionately.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">

    &#34;I am not like that&#34; is exactly how russians escape responsibility and being held accountable for every #GenocideOfUkrainians.<br />
    </p>
    &mdash; <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1531886808581251072">Link</a>
</blockquote>

What was a disaster of a lifetime to me, Nadya saw as a PR-opportunity. If you google "Ukraine DAO Pussy Riot", you will see how many interviews she gave on our behalf. I dare you to find a single article where she mentions my involvement - or that of any other 🇺🇦 person.

Now, THIS is actually a fucking pisstake. 

To turn [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) into a "Pussyverse" ad - you have to be messed up on another level.

You didn't start [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) with a number of friends, Nadya.

I started it on 21 Feb with my friends. 

A 🇺🇦 person, not r*ssian.

My name was removed from press releases even after I repeatedly added it there myself and [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) claimed to all the journalists that they started this DAO - no mention of Ukrainian people or their efforts. 
What-so-ever 🙃
Instead, they did this: [pic.twitter.com/vvCXMlTj9S](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1540796950320074755/video/1)

The reason why all of this is very important to talk about is not due to some egoistic pettiness:

✨There is a pattern in 🇺🇦 history whereby russians, even the ones who claim to be in opposition, take credit for the work/art of Ukrainians. 

✨ It's part of their culture.

After the distribution of funds in the early March, Nadya leaves the project (info on who now manages funds - here: [ukraine-dao.notion.site: Multisig & Treasury - UkraineDAO.eth](https://ukraine-dao.notion.site/Multisig-Treasury-UkraineDAO-eth-b080b59f794848fa8f6ac1b22575792c) ) 

⚡️Weeks later, with no prior notice, she storms into the UKD chat that has about 150 people, infuriatied by this tweet about [@ICRC](https://twitter.com/ICRC)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">

🧵 about the Red Cross, [@ICRC](https://twitter.com/ICRC) in particular - here.

📖 TLDR - they're legitimizing r*ssia and assist r*ssia with forceful deportation of Ukrainians.

❗️There are great people working for the Red Cross and they can address their concerns with their management if they wish.

Storming into the chat Nadya didn't into account 2 things:

1️⃣ how much work I was doing non-stop while she was giving interviews 

2️⃣ I do not give a fuck how famous someone is so this diva behaviour doesn't work with me😂

| :-: |

After being told by other [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) contributors to go in the direction of the russian warship, Nadya disappeared. I recently reached out to her friend  to ask Nadya to stop presenting herself as a co-founder & using our cause for hype - radio silence. 
Reminds me of this:

This tweet was addressed to another donkey, but applies to [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) too. 

🤷‍♀️ I do not know how much money Pussy Riot made from all the concerts where they're waving the 🇺🇦 flag.

🙃 Equally, I don't deserve for anyone to be mad at me for being able to cover my rent.

BTW, the timing of this "exposé" from [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) may have something to do with what I said yesterday in [@TheChoiceDAO](https://twitter.com/TheChoiceDAO) group chat.

I know, it's very sad when russians aren't allowed to hype themselves using the cause they don't really care about.

No, [@KevinDuska](https://twitter.com/KevinDuska) 

The situation is very simple:

✅ russians (Pussy Riot) have the right to use the war in Ukraine for hype.

✅ A Ukrainian person should be sad, miserable and live on the street, if live at all.

Typical russian attitude, I laughed when I saw their tweet:)

Got this [@decrypt](https://twitter.com/decrypt) headline in my inbox this morning - I receive alerts when [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) is mentioned in the media. The article features a photo of Nadya from [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) at a peace march in support of Ukraine - the country she doesn't care about.

I've been getting loads of abuse online. It's important to publicise this - what happens to me is basically Ukraine on a mini-scale. 

BTW, here's what Nadya of [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) was concerned about in March, during genocide - 🇷🇺 world domination. This is sickening, not "cute".

Lots of people watched what Nadya [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) did and didn't say anything despite knowing very well how wrong she was.
❓What happens as a result?

🇷🇺 & russians think they can get away with more, and they do - because they can. 

🤷‍♀️ Because Ukrainians don't matter as much.

Interesting question #2: when are [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) planning to remove this delusional tweet and issue a public apology?

Interesting question #3: why do russians never do their homework before making accusations like this? This is just hella lazy 🤣

to russian "anti-war" "feminists", a Ukrainian person should live on the street while they make an unreported amounts of money using our tragedy for their hype.

❗️I cannot even explain how many people (many of whom I admire and respect), were telling me to not even try to argue publicly with a much more famous 🇷🇺 "celebrity". 

❗️I refused to normalise bullying of other Ukrainians by accepting mine. It was a matter of dignity.

❗️I explain to people every day that russians should be held accountable for their actions.

❗️I also try to practice what I preach.

💞 I'm very proud that I didn't give in to the pressure and thanks to the community's effort, the russian "feminist" warship fucked off 💞

    ✅ we can prove their accusations are false - everything is on blockchain <br />

We need to stop glorifying russians for saying they’re against war. 

Everyone in their sound mind is against war. It’s not an achievement.

Decent article in Spanish explaining what happened.

Incorrect data in the end where amounts in our treasury are mentioned but otherwise it’s a good summary 

TLDR:

🦄 FSB-itches didn’t do their homework

[observatorioblockchain.com: Pussy Riot acusa a Alona, cofundadora de UkraineDAO, de cobrar sueldo](https://observatorioblockchain.com/criptomonedas/pussy-riot-acusa-a-alona-cofundadora-de-ukrainedao-de-asignarse-un-sueldo-no-consensuado/)

Translation of the relevant paragraph from the article above.

❓ Why all of this is so important? 

We need to stop glorifying the 🇷🇺 “opposition” that behaves like a typical gopnik

People need to know what [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) represent
