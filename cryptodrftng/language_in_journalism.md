Usage of language in journalism around Ukraine - üßµ

This is excellent and I was planning to write about it myself but [@LvivNightingale](https://twitter.com/LvivNightingale) did an incredible job,
please max RT and share with all the journalists you know.

I don't know why I'm supposed to "keep the blockchain part of the story" to myself as someone just said to me - [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) made the largest donation to [@BackAndAlive](https://twitter.com/BackAndAlive) in its history. In crypto.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    - What is the largest donation to @BackAndAlive?<br />
    - Probably $4m in crypto from @Ukraine_DAO. I don&#39;t remember others, tbh. There are some companies that frequently give smaller amounts, so their total amount may be larger.  But as a one-off, it&#39;s this one.<br />

We are also on the Verified Ukraine Donations List and are grateful for the support of the Ukrainian government, [@abornyakov](https://twitter.com/abornyakov) of [@mintsyfra](https://twitter.com/mintsyfra) in particular üíôüíõ

Ukraine is a crypto-native country and one of the world leaders in terms of crypto adoption.

    5/ @Ukraine_DAO Trucks went into an actual warzone to deliver food to civilians in the Kharkiv region. This has literally never been done before by a DAO.<br />
    <br />
    The trucks are partially powered by ETH donations - huge thank you to @kmets_ for being their big supporter ‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/GXefO3f2QW https://t.co/elTPNPkzJo<br />

I'm launching a fundraiser in a few days for the vehicles my dad (he runs UKD Trucks w/ mum), buys for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 

He's already donated several of them to [@DefenceU](https://twitter.com/DefenceU). Will check exactly how many when he wakes up but the last figure I remember was 4 of these:
