[@FreeRossDAO](https://twitter.com/FreeRossDAO) now has lots of girls which is great üòç

‚ú®There are a few reasons why there are few female web3 leaders, but I believe they are more complex then the  "bro culture". 
‚ú®Tbh, 99% of my interactions with males both in crypto and beyond are overwhelmingly positive.

    @cryptodrftng @ParakhRushil @TryCrypto @Ukraine_DAO We&#39;ve definitely succeeded in attracting a very diverse leadership team since then.<br />
    <br />
    I think having @cryptodrftng as an early leader in our team sent a signal that it was a space where diverse voices are respected and welcomed.<br />

Hey [@coinfessions](https://twitter.com/coinfessions)! 

It depends on what kind of job you want/your skillset, but my best work in crypto - helping my dear [@RJPinnell](https://twitter.com/RJPinnell) run [@FreeRossDAO](https://twitter.com/FreeRossDAO) & then launching [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) came out of passion‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

Look around - are there projects working on causes you deeply care about?üëÄ

    I&#39;ve been trying to get a job in crypto for the last few months. As a girl, sometimes it feels like a boys club and I don&#39;t know how to fit in. Maybe I&#39;m just bad a networking.<br />
