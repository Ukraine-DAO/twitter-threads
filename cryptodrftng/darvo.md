Day 87 of 🇺🇦 nation suffering from genocide while being expected to justify our right to exist to the very people who are paying for the aggressor to carry on.

For years we've been accused of things they embody themselves. It's called DARVO in psychology. Look it up.

A russian speaker from Eastern Ukraine, for some reason I spend every day & night trying to help Ukraine's defenders save 🇺🇦 from the 🇷🇺 Nazis. But it's not the ruscists & [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) that bother lots of people, it's Azov's symbols they're ignorant about.
