🧵The Kremlin pushes the idea that [#Ukraine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ukraine) is corrupt. This is wrong. Let me share here the high level findings of the 5th Round of Monitoring Under the OECD Istanbul [#AntiCorruption](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AntiCorruption) Action Plan. Link to full report ▶️
[Anti-Corruption Reforms in Ukraine](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/anti-corruption-reforms-in-ukraine_b1901b8c-en)

▶️[#Ukraine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ukraine)'s National Agency for Corruption Prevention (NACP) developed a draft [#AntiCorruption](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AntiCorruption)
strategy in 2020.
▶️Ukraine’s conflict of interest legal framework is comprehensive and the NACP is assigned to oversee its implementation; enforcement by courts is low (needs work)

▶️Asset and interest disclosure system is well-advanced in [#Ukraine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ukraine). The fully electronic system
includes declarations in easily searchable, open data format.
▶️Ukraine has strengthened its already comprehensive framework for protection of whistleblowers.

▶️Numerous reforms ongoing in the past in the area of judicial independence; more work needed on judicial independence and integrity.
▶️Primary public procurement legislation covers all areas of economic activity.

▶️ 🇺🇦 has made an unprecedented leap in tackling high-level corruption through dedicated independent investigative, prosecutorial and judicial institutions. Many high-level corruption allegations have been dealt with in accordance with law, but examples of interference remain.

So much has been done in a short amount of time. Ukraine is developing strong, transparent institutions. Ukrainian society will surely demand that this continues.
