Great question.

Germans clearly don't see the lives of people in certain countries as equally valuable as their own ones

More than that - 🇺🇦 lives concern them less than russians being able to get tourist visas to 🇪🇺 as they are killing us and destroying our homes.

Here is a great 🧵 explaining what's happening in the German mind. From my interactions with Germans, the analysis is very accurate.

    The now infamous open letter by &#39;intellectuals &amp; artists&#39; calling on #Germany to stop supporting #Ukraine [&amp;, effectively, for 🇺🇦&#39;s capitulation to #Russia] is very revealing. As well as being patronising as hell &amp; totally wrong I think its shows something else too ... 1/ https://t.co/Fqwlms7OZ7<br />

I also keep a 🧵 where I interpret the nonsense that another genocide apologist says in 🇫🇷
He lost all credibility due to worrying too much about the feelings of the genocidal dictator who lives in a bunker, but he hasn't realised it yet - too arrogant.

Re generalisations - pretty sure it's the job of  Germans to sort out their mess, not on Ukrainians to be delicate with words as they are being slaughtered.

Generalisations are not fair, yeah

Genocide is a million times less fair though

    @cryptodrftng I don’t think that is a fair generalization to make as any country’s citizens can be accused of being provincial or self interested. Certainly prior to February the fate of people in Mali, S. Sudan, Burundi etc was abstract<br />

On a similar note - are Ukrainians seriously expected to listen about how Germans are unfairly judged?

Doesn't anyone notice... anything fundamentally wrong with that? 

Should we feel sorry for them for potential high gas bills too?

    @Neverrpcv @cryptodrftng Ok everyone get your magnifying glasses out and let’s see if we can find them individually. Never mind there is genocide and war being committed we mustn’t “generalise”. https://t.co/IwvanNLdAP<br />

Btw, we designed a warm jacket for Germans to wear when the temperature drops below 18C. Called it "I Love Cheap Gas"

Although it only exists in our imagination - pretty much like Germany's military help to Ukraine, you know

If those friends have the 🇩🇪 government support as they became refugees - very grateful but if the same government loved russian money a bit less, they wouldn't need that support in the first place.

War is expensive and russia wouldn't be able to afford it.

Not sure why we should be acknowledging their concerns. 

They've been helping russia to make us vulnerable for decades now, so their concerns are worth jack shit - and so is their "democracy" and "European values"

    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    @cryptodrftng FYI 3 Ukrainian friends are residing in Germany now with government support. Yes at the leadership level Germany has been deficient and prevaricating in many ways but let’s acknowledge the concern of many Germans as well<br />
