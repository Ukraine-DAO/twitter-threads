Nothing could prepare me for the feeling of terror and shock of seeing airstrikes on the city that was once my home - and for me it was only on Twitter, I'm lucky.

I first told about the impact of this war on the mental health of 🇺🇦 to [@samuel_haig](https://twitter.com/samuel_haig) for [@DefiantNews](https://twitter.com/DefiantNews)

Our co-founder's SO Masha, a 🇺🇦-born LA-based psychologist launched [@MindfulWebz](https://twitter.com/MindfulWebz) - Ukraine DAO’s mental health support project.

We collect and publish resources on how to cope with the war-related trauma and provide a space for people to share their emotions.

The best 🧵 on how to behave with Ukrainians written by a non-Ukrainian person, our contributor [@NovelSci](https://twitter.com/NovelSci): [twitter.com/NovelSci/statu…](https://twitter.com/NovelSci/status/1529734072150413312)

There were multiple times recently when I didn't want to live. 

Thing is, I didn't feel the urge to go and harm myself. 

A lot of Ukrainians will feel that urge and that's not their fault.

Please think about that next time when you speak to a 🇺🇦 person, and read this 🧵:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ Over the last 100&#43; days, I&#39;ve had all sorts of breakdowns and I&#39;m extremely mentally stable person.<br />
    I&#39;ve stared at the wall all day (before the invasion, afterwards I didn&#39;t have the time)<br />
    I&#39;ve cried for hours.<br />
    I&#39;ve told close friends I don&#39;t want to be in this world anymore. https://t.co/eZxkm5683z<br />

I also encourage everyone to listen to this conversation. None of this abuse was called out by the hosts of the Twitter Spaces I was in. Instead they chose to harass me more. 

I'm lucky I have the resilience to handle this, but why should I have to?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ Expectations for a Ukrainian: Apologise to russians.<br />
    <br />
    This conversation happened in Twitter Spaces a couple days ago in front of 400 people. Sharing so it&#39;s easier to understand what I have to deal with every other day. <br />

For those wondering what it feels like to be Ukrainian these days:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ Ukrainians don&#39;t complain much but I hope they don&#39;t mind me saying this: I speak 4 languages and none of them has words that can describe how much it hurts to be one of us these days. <br />
    <br />
    Each of us has been in agony from 1000s propaganda cuts. Literally, lie on a lie on a lie.<br />

Attaching a VERY outdated list of things I've been called lately as a Ukrainian person expressing the most normal thoughts. 

There will be at least 3-4 updates with new accusations, including me being a 🇷🇺 agent, and of course this beautiful aphorism by [@StephenKolanko1](https://twitter.com/StephenKolanko1) 💞

⚡️Breaking news for many people  - the feelings of russians DO NOT MATTER right now.

If you see a "good" russian person bleating about "russophobia" - tell them to shut the fuck up. 

Also, if that's what they're currently worrying about - they're not a good person at all.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    I seriously can&#39;t believe I have to explain to people that they should have empathy for Ukrainians and that empathy means more than putting a Ukrainian flag in your Twitter username.<br />

In this video [@brokenpixelua](https://twitter.com/brokenpixelua) explains why Ukrainians shouldn't listen about "russophobia", and russian people being "victims" or god forbid "heroes". I can't believe we even have to explain this, but he summarised it perfectly in 1 sentence:

"It's too late to be a hero."

How to check whether what you say to a Ukrainian person makes sense:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ Quick rule of thumb for &#34;experts&#34;: before saying something about Ukrainians and russian Nazis, replace them in the same sentence with &#34;Jewish people&#34; and &#34;German Nazis&#34; and consider if you&#39;d say that in public. If you wouldn&#39;t, then it&#39;s not appropriate. You&#39;re welcome. 🙂<br />
