    A trident is 🇺🇦 Coat of Arms &amp; emblem of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who sacrifice their lives every day to delay a huge war that will break out in Europe if @Bundeskanzler, @EmmanuelMacron and other idiots don&#39;t get their shit together. https://t.co/VQpiT9C6a4 https://t.co/jQ85XpBS9h<br />
