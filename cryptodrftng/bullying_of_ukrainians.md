I'm a very friendly and understanding person. For the last 8 years I've been telling people that russia is a fascist state that is about to commit [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) 

I'm not taking shit from the people who are "pro-Ukraine" but bully me every single day.

I encourage everyone to listen to this conversation. None of this abuse has been called out by the hosts of the Twitter Spaces I was in. Instead they chose to harass myself and people like [@KevinDuska](https://twitter.com/KevinDuska) who spoke up against them. [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ Expectations for a Ukrainian: Apologise to russians.<br />
    <br />
    This conversation happened in Twitter Spaces a couple days ago in front of 400 people. Sharing so it&#39;s easier to understand what I have to deal with every other day. <br />

I heard zero apologies and seen zero efforts to put things right from the hosts present during the conversation above. [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians)

Instead, when I came back to address what happened, I received more abuse for over an hour. These people are now claiming to be the victims. [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians)

    A full hour of #OSINTUkraine folk colonizing a Ukrainian. Obviously, these mostly American &#34;OSINT&#34; &#34;specialists&#34; know better than @cryptodrftng and @MuKappa <br />

Here's what a Ukrainian person has to listen to during [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) and [@GrammarDomin8rx](https://twitter.com/GrammarDomin8rx) hosting the spaces has zero issues with it. Speaks volumes.

    @KevinDuska @Ryan_v404 @MuKappa Today he said he never swore at me and never said I was as bad as russians 😂 Bless. https://t.co/hRQi9G1icN<br />

Here's what they did to "put things right". I think Ukraine is ok without supporters like that.

    33/ I didn&#39;t have a fallout - a few hosts repeatedly tolerated me being publicly denigrated and then engaged in the same themselves &#43; also started harrassing me in the spaces I was co-hosting with @ndboulton.

Now, I don't know if they're doing this at someone's command or they're just stupid but they definitely don't support Ukraine and they're more worried about their egos and the imaginary problems of russian babies than the actual suffering of Ukrainian children.

    Enabling grifters, banning those who don&#39;t get into the Groupthink, shouting abuse at Ukrainians. But it&#39;s &#34;bad actors&#34; out to get them. Yup!  #CircularFiringSquad #OSINTUkraine 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 cc @cryptodrftng <br />

Extended (still very incomplete) version. [@ndboulton](https://twitter.com/ndboulton) you need to prepare the updates to this list with the stuff from the last 2 days, especially [@StephenKolanko1](https://twitter.com/StephenKolanko1) 😂 
✅ shitty personality
✅ "mentality of putin"
✅ bitch 
✅ should be thankful I'm not in a filtration camp

If you're curious about the filtration camp thing - I got you covered 👌

[@StephenKolanko1](https://twitter.com/StephenKolanko1) you must be hella proud of yourself 

This is some next level cruelty, Nazis that you adore would be jealous.

For a bit of context about who they were saying all this to. I don't publicise probably about 70% of what I do. [@TankGirljunkie](https://twitter.com/TankGirljunkie) can confirm :)

Thanks [@HansWorldTravls](https://twitter.com/HansWorldTravls) [@UkrainesGrains](https://twitter.com/UkrainesGrains) for providing more evidence for me. The fact that you think this screenshot makes ME look bad is hilarious 😂 Does anyone has the recording of me coming in with "guns blazing"? 🤣 [twitter.com/HansWorldTravl…](https://twitter.com/HansWorldTravls/status/1534698342529236993)

@Ukrainesgraines [@HansWorldTravls](https://twitter.com/HansWorldTravls) has my number because I was trying to help him with HIS work before I knew what kind of person he was. Can't believe he is tweeting this out himself 🤣🤣🤣

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    @HansWorldTravls @cryptodrftng @UkrainesGrains But guys, Hans wormed his way into a woman&#39;s trust and then betrayed that same trust by doing the exact thing he was claiming to protect her from. 😅<br />
    <br />
    Lmao, this whole thing isn&#39;t so bad because you were strangers my guy. It&#39;s because you abused someone who trusted you.<br />
