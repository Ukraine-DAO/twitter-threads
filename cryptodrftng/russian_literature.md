# About russian literature, culture and what they have to do with the genocide of Ukrainians

Sorry but no, the 🇷🇺 literature is really not essential in understanding man. The nature of the "mysterious 🇷🇺  soul" can be seen in [#Mariupol](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mariupol) these days💔

🇺🇦 Instead I invite everyone to register for this Ukrainian Culture & Literature course:

    @cryptodrftng I totally get why, but let&#39;s not claim gold is tin from now on, as our emotions tell us so. There is gold in the Russian classics, which means they aren&#39;t Russia&#39;s anymore, they&#39;ve become and go on being the world&#39;s. It&#39;s art essential in understanding man, still true today. 1/<br />

Pushkin doesn't need putin to breed monsters, btw. His "Poltava" and multiple other "masterpieces" glorify 🇷🇺 imperialism.
⚡ Ukraine has its own unique culture and has produced plenty of literature for us to read and promote ⚡
We should focus on that.

    @cryptodrftng Even if Putin were a direct family descendant of Pushkin, it doesn&#39;t make the poet a breeder of monsters. He remains The Poet and will never be soiled by today&#39;s spilt blood and awful atrocities. Goethe, even Wagner will never be soiled by Hitler&#39;s and his many, many accolites. 2<br />

I've read the vast majority of what's considered "classical russian literature". I read "Crime & Punishment" when I was 13.

I will never read a russian book again. Not reading imperialist russian literature is the least everyone can and should do.

Over 350 of Ukraine’s cultural sites have already been destroyed or damaged by the genocidal russian invasion. If it's Pushkin that you are worrying about right now - that's sad.

If you want to discover 🇺🇦 culture instead - welcome to [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO)

"Crime and Punishment" is literally about a young loser who hasn't achieved anything in life killing an old woman and stealing her purse. Reminds you of anything? 

Sorry to break it to you, but Ukranian literature has much cooler stuff to read 🤯 I know, shocking stuff!

Here I am being expected to care about the aggressor's feelings while russia is destroying pretty much everything and everyone who is dear to me in life. 

Normalisation of russian imperialism and exceptionalism is a core element of "russian culture" 👌

I am saying that as a russian (as well as 🇺🇦) speaking Ukrainian from 🇺🇦 Ukraine, I am SICKENED that the same nation that carried out the Holodomor didn't even wait a 100 years before it came back to do the same thing to us.

To make things even more disgusting, they used the word "genocide" and came up with a fake narrative that russian speakers were being persecuted in Eastern 🇺🇦 which is absolute nonsense and I've been saying this for 8 years:

I am also saying that russians bleating about being discriminated against while Ukrainians are going through actual unspeakable violence is unacceptable, tone deaf and vile. There is no "russophobia". There is "being held accountable for the first time".

Bots, trolls and other morons will be immediately blocked. I'm not bending to anyone's gaslighting and guilt tripping.

Result? [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) is happening again. You know why? Because they know they always get away with it. Nothing is going to happen because they can just start bleating afterwards they had nothing to do with it. That they're the victim. And then that it didn't happen.

For over 8 (!) years I was saying that this was going to happen. You think I was heard / listened to? Taken seriously? 
No. It's too hard to accept that a Ukrainian woman can be better educated on this and better placed to comment. I have "bias of the person being oppressed".

Deliberate neglect is standing by while something awful happens and doing little or nothing to stop it. But they're not just not stopping the genocide. They're happy about it. They don't understand why we don't love them. They "can't do anything wrong". [@CalinIonescu5](https://twitter.com/CalinIonescu5)

And as that is happening, what you call a "tragedy" is that I don't want to read Dostoevsky and to forget their occupant language. People aren't very busy calling them out but I am policed online every day for what I say about them. I'm the "extremist" here.
[@CalinIonescu5](https://twitter.com/CalinIonescu5)

Every other day I'm shouted at publicly, told that I have a horrible attitude, and that I should be ashamed of the radical things I say. My radical "russophobia" means holding russians accountable to the same standard as others would be. On an individual level. Wild idea 🤯

    @djw155 @cryptodrftng To me that one things that makes Russian literature is taken from Bloom&#39;s Western Canon, Pushkin, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov. To which one could add Gorki, and from the 20th century Pasternak, Grossman, Solzhenitsyn. I think that&#39;s pretty compact for that &#34;one thing&#34; that spawn<br />

Sorry for upsetting fans of Tolstoy singing praise to russian troops - neglecting a russian man who's been dead for over 110+ years is of course more important than [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) happening as we speak.

No I won't "have to" cancel everything. The people opressed by the English & Dutch etc can cancel whoever they want - it's not for me to lecture them.

[@kvakes](https://twitter.com/kvakes), the tweet you replied to is the beginning of a 🧵 where I explain why russian literature/culture and genocide are related. I'll be happy to continue the conversation once you've taken in my perspective. [twitter.com/kvakes/status/…](https://twitter.com/kvakes/status/1535542793241862145)

Yes. And I do believe very strongly that their opinions carry more weight and should be listened to more than someone's who's never known senseless violence like this. russians turned the most russian-speaking city into ruin - just because it was in Ukraine.
