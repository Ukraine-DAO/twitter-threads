❓What if tourist visa ban affects 🇷🇺 asylum seekers?

This is a great point to address.

Here’s what a “vulnerable group”, known as “anti-war, feminists, pro-LGBT” blabla [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) did to me, years after getting protection from the West. 

Did Putin forced them to do this?

    The tourist visa ban itself is fundamentally a good idea, and it should go further than that by revoking residence from those who benefited from Putin&#39;s regime, from oligarchs to propagandists, but it has to be coupled with measures to protect vulnerable groups<br />

❗️Here’s what [@nadyariot](https://twitter.com/nadyariot) of [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) worries about during [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians), look at the screenshot 👇

She is glorified (!) for saying she is “against war” even those all of her behaviour goes to say the opposite. 

This is SICKENING.

    That&#39;s her dream amidst the genocide.<br />

❗️TLDR of the story: she went after me, after 200 interviews taking credit for my work. 

She thought she could do this - because she is russian (lol)

She is allowed anything. No one ever pushed back on her BS. I was advised by everyone to continue putting up with abuse.

Continue to feel sorry for russians, dear Western audience.

They’ll come to your country to kill everyone they can, steal your work as you’re fighting against genocide, turn around, call you a liar and say that it was a Pussyverse ad.

BTW, I’m still waiting for public apologies from [@nadyariot](https://twitter.com/nadyariot) of [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) who must’ve been shocked to find out that a Ukrainian woman is not going to bow down to FSB-itches 🤯😱 

+ financial reporting from her collective using [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) as a Pussyverse ad.

    Reminder:<br />
    ❌ Going after a 🇺🇦 woman during #GenocideOfUkrainians is not feminism<br />
    ✅ Everything r*ssian is going in the direction of the 🇷🇺 warship (in r*ssian - нахуй), and @pussyrrriot too 💝 https://t.co/0sq0L1Gw8r https://t.co/zXLWMkdKm3<br />

To summarise: 

Blanket visa ban for all russians is the absolute minimum every country should impose.

For all russians. Because all russians are responsible for [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians)

    @Mortis_Banned @radioevrazia @nadyariot @pussyrrriot I think it&#39;s reasonable to say that genocide takes different forms - Nadya works on the cultural front of it, erasing Ukrainians from existence in the info space. <br />
    <br />
    Therefore, she supports #GenocideOfUkrainians <br />

russians have no problem "hating Putin" and hating Ukrainians at the same time. They should live in russia.
