UPD: I'm also an "idiot playing into russians' hands" because by "generalising" about russians who are cheering to [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians), I become equal to them and I "support genocide too".

    1/ I&#39;m turning into some sort of controversial person for saying the obvious things.<br />
    <br />
    In the morning I was &#34;unprofessional&#34; for telling a troll, who wouldn&#39;t shut up in someone&#39;s Twitter Spaces for ages, to fuck off. <br />
    <br />
    Now I&#39;m a &#34;cyber bully&#34; for not tolerating being yelled at.<br />

FYI russians don't need for me to say anything, they live in a parallel universe full of "Ukrainian Nazis", "separatists" and other unicorns I've personally never met in my life growing up in Eastern Ukraine:) It makes zero difference for them what we say. They still kill us.

    &#34;Ukrainians are psychotic and miserable people, they want to kill us, Russian people. The Ukrainian people are sick, Ukraine is a cancer within Europe. https://t.co/683ZvGURpN<br />

That gentleman also said that there must be something wrong in my life for me to be like this. Yes, there is: 

russians are dropping thermobaric bombs on the people I love. And russians back in russia are cheering to that. [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians)

    A family came back to Bucha. Little Daryna wanted to play her piano, but her mother noticed that the prizes on top of the piano had been moved around. She opened the lid and found a bomb inside. A farewell ‚Äúgift‚Äù from the Russians<br />

The manipulation technique used on me today is called DARVO - look it up.
Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender.

"I am not like that" is exactly how russians escape responsibility and being held accountable for every [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians).

    2/ Meanwhile, Ukrainians, including myself, are being patronised and lectured every single day and told about how we &#34;should not generalise&#34; because &#34;not all russians are like that&#34;. <br />
    I want to ask everyone: where the fuck are those mythical &#34;different russians?&#34;<br />

    3/ I have a few good russian friends and none of them, literally none of them, have an issue with me being mad at russians. Because they hate russia and everything it&#39;s about too. They don&#39;t have the arrogance to tell me how I should be feeling right now. And neither should you.<br />

    4/ I speak and write in russian better than the vast majority of russians. I&#39;ve read most of what&#39;s called &#34;classical russian literature&#34;. I&#39;ve met more russians in my life than all of the people lecturing me have, combined. Don&#39;t lecture me about who *most* russians are.<br />
