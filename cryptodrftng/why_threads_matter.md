There is a reason why I make all of this public - it's important for people to see what a 🇺🇦 person goes through every day. It's not just a "feverish twitter spats".

    @cryptodrftng @pussyrrriot A lot of time spent on feverish twitter spats, however understandable, isn&#39;t getting real 1st hand info out about what&#39;s happening in 🇺🇦. There really is a huge lack of Eng subs on info videos, it&#39;s always being mentioned. It would help hugely if you &amp; others could provide more.<br />

I was under impression that our team, [@garbanzo0813](https://twitter.com/garbanzo0813) in particular and myself were doing well on that front.

Here's our last piece of work - [@MuKappa](https://twitter.com/MuKappa), @tiinakatariina [@garbanzo0813](https://twitter.com/garbanzo0813) & others helped a lot.

I just talked to [@garbanzo0813](https://twitter.com/garbanzo0813) about it 2 days ago, but will repeat again - translating content like that is deeply traumatising for Ukrainians.

    .@garbanzo0813 and I are now translating one of the most disgusting interviews I&#39;ve seen in my whole life. <br />

Yura and I often feel physically sick from just reading what we need to translate. Don't take it for granted. And certainly please, for the love of god, don't tell us what and how much we should do while we are being killed.

I coordinate work of over 150 people every day across different projects, all of them for Ukraine. Neglected everything a normal person does in normal times, why do I have people telling me I'm not doing enough? Seriously don't get it.

Mentions of Ukraine on social media are falling day by day. It matters a lot, btw.

There is a reason why I do the things I do - if I didn’t explain it to someone personally, it doesn’t mean that reason is not there.

    @polaris_gb @Ukraine_DAO @pussyrrriot @cryptodrftng @TheChoiceDAO If you&#39;re referring to UkraineDAO, there&#39;s only one salary being paid, and it&#39;s far from excessive.<br />
    <br />
    @cryptodrftng deserves far more. I was part of the group who lobbied for funds to be diverted for her living expenses. She&#39;s literally giving her life for the cause.<br />

Yes, there could be an account like that - why don’t you set it up? I actually haven’t seen what you’re talking about (users asking for translations & getting ignored).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    @cryptodrftng @pussyrrriot I am on 🇺🇦 side. I see ordinary twitter users constantly asking for translations, getting ignored. What should they do? How can they request translations &amp; information easily? Could there be an accessible account that just tweets requested translations &amp; info on physical protests<br />

A lot of people also have stressful lives? Seriously? We made a database for those struggling people - [twitter.com/cryptodrftng/s…](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1538905606173622275?s=21&t=VwCmkatlr0-CSOZehSSb9A)

Anything else I haven’t done?

    @cryptodrftng @pussyrrriot In the 🇬🇧 without the firehose of personal back &amp; forth? A lot of people also have stressful lives &amp; little time, a simple, streamline source of such go-to information is lacking. It&#39;s hard to follow endless looping personal threads &amp; quote tweets to get nuggets of info.<br />
