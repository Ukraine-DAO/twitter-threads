💡I had no idea that Lifeline Ukraine was founded by [@PaulNiland](https://twitter.com/PaulNiland) even though it's been on top of the relevant page in [@MindfulWebz](https://twitter.com/MindfulWebz) mental health support resources 😱

🌈❤️ Thank you [@SarahAshtonLV](https://twitter.com/SarahAshtonLV) for highlighting the incredible work Paul & team are doing

    For those who don&#39;t know him, this is @PaulNiland. <br />
    <br />
    An icon, and a hero of Ukraine, he founded Lifeline Ukraine, the nation&#39;s first suicide prevention hotline. <br />

    My interview with Paul will be coming soon, until then follow him for a look at life in Kyiv and around Ukraine. https://t.co/Dn4rQ4DM6C<br />

Attaching the 🧵 containing a lot of stuff on mental health of Ukrainians and the work [@MindfulWebz](https://twitter.com/MindfulWebz), myself and [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) community have been doing to collectively deal with the trauma that russians are inflicting on Ukrainians.

Also here's one of the latest 🧵 I wrote about mental health of Ukrainians after being lectured in public for 500 times 🥲

🧠 Why you should NOT host Twitter Spaces involving Ukrainians if your ability to empathise with them & maintain composure is impaired:

🚨MUST READ FOR EVERYONE

❗️Officially the best 🧵 on how to behave with Ukrainians by a non-🇺🇦 person - our v own [@NovelSci](https://twitter.com/NovelSci) 

❗️I openly advocate for our right to hate russians. I'll always hate them

❗️If you don't hate russians, you don't know them well

🚨This is the kind of abuse I have to listen to on a daily basis during genocide 

🚨 Meanwhile, 🇷🇺 is using the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe as a shield to launch rockets at my family members - [twitter.com/cryptodrftng/s…](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1546938465346093058?s=21&t=yRoLasAixjtT9RDT4HxHyQ)

    This conversation happened in Twitter Spaces a couple days ago in front of 400 people. Sharing so it&#39;s easier to understand what I have to deal with every other day. <br />

❗️Asking a Ukrainian to ignore & tolerate abuse to avoid "drama" - appeasement politics on a mini scale

❗️How are we surprised that russians are committing all the horrific war crimes if we can't stop Ukrainians verbally (!) abused during genocide?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ Received a lot of DMs asking for examples of things I&#39;ve been told by abusive people.<br />
    <br />
    Here is a good example. Not a single time do I raise my voice or lose composure in any way. <br />
    <br />
    After this incident, my team and I were harassed online by a whole group of people for weeks. https://t.co/IteO1jsLd9<br />

This 🧵 explains why by silencing Ukrainians or shaming us for being angry, we are creating an information space in which:

- it's ok to kill Ukrainians for no reason 

- but it's not ok to hurt someone's ego

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    ❗This is an extremely important point.<br />
    <br />
    ❗The reason why russians are committing genocide now with zero shame is because they got away with it last time.<br />
    <br />
    ❗People who silence us or shame Ukrainians for being angry should realise one simple thing - you are helping them kill us. https://t.co/W32HXMisMo<br />

Sorry, forgot about numbering. 

Why did I start talking about all this in  a mental health 🧵?

The moments when I didn't want to live didn't happen when I saw [#Bucha](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bucha) 

They were from the incredible arrogance, ignorance & continued appeasement that followed. It's sickening.

We should really stop with this nonsense:

🚩 "Let's not talk about what's up with you, let's talk about UKRAINE" just to proceed to talk about the battles like it's some fucking video game

That's not actually what "supporting 🇺🇦" means

It's gaslighting and I'm sick of it.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    If someone claims to support 🇺🇦, they have to show basic respect to Ukrainians<br />
    <br />
    ❗️I work 24/7, no days off. Barely leave the house. My loved ones are risking their lives every day - to defend 🇺🇦, which is not a real life Call of Duty game to entertain homegrown &#34;OSINT&#34;  experts. https://t.co/IvbVqNMO3e<br />

[@NovelSci](https://twitter.com/NovelSci) that's from the creators of

🚩 "Let's not talk about what's up with you, let's talk about UKRAINE" 

I have one thing to say to those people:

✨go

✨fuck

✨yourself

    You know what&#39;s awful? When people imply only their research perspective has value by portraying anyone else&#39;s as a distraction from &#34;the real problem.&#34; How egocentric do you have to be to argue only your perspective is worthwhile? Yikes. I choose to support other scholars.<br />
