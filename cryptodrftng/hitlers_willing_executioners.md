Ok, now this is completely wrong about the Holocaust and this is not supported by any factual evidence whatsoever.

üìöI recommend this book to everyone worrying about poor russians who have no idea what's happening and would do something if they could.

    @Irradihate @ohrwurm_AT @cryptodrftng @wowanyname4now @djw155 @ndboulton @CANADA566 @RafaelMontob @ZeroZhvk This is exactly a mirror image of the Jews after WW2 and the blanket hate of Germans. It‚Äôs still a debate with historians whether the German public knew and was an ‚Äúopen secret‚Äù or was unknown by the public.<br />

About [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) that is happening right now. 

russians: 1Ô∏è‚É£ know about it. 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Most of them are cheering to it (!) 

Actions they do to stop it: distracting themselves in between killing civilians to steal a washing machine or a doghouse.

    But hatred towars Ukraine and Ukrainians, imperialism, general Russian issue, separate from Putin&#39;s mafia state. In fact Russian &#34;opposition&#34; is not less imperialistic than p*tin, they&#39;re just not happy that he&#39;s a thief and cannot kill us efficiently. Our opinion on that matters<br />
