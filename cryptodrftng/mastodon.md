I know what you mean, have been suspended for no apparent reason before. Backup of everything I post is at [UkraineDAO!](https://masto.ukrainedao.love/)

If it's too extreme for Twitter to say Ukrainians have the right to hate people who are killing us in our homes - I don't mind being suspended.

    @cryptodrftng For me the challenge is to not get suspended by Twitter. Hate it when that happens. Really, there should be no restrictions when bashing Russians. It&#39;s not like they follow the rules in real life.... just saying.<br />
