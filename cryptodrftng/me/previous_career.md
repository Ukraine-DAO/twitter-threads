I used to be a cat sitter in my litigation paralegal days because my salary was very low by London standards and I didn't want to ask my parents for help. Reviews are very funny to read but very sweet üòÇ

    @cryptodrftng I love cats.  My cats usually don&#39;t use the litter box.  They go outside.  Unless the temperature drops below about 15‚Å∞ fahrenheit.  Then that litterbox looks inviting.  Also if it snows more than a foot.  In summer if I am planting my cats will fertilize.<br />

More reviews üòÇ Had a very tough time when I got Sasha and moved from that area because some owners were refusing to leave their cats with anyone else and I missed the cats too üíî
