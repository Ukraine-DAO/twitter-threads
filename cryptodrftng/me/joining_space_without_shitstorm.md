It's very funny to hear people say to each other "it's important to listen to people with different political views" when they talk about me - 99% of the things I say are supported by the vast majority of the Ukrainians I know.

    1/ I&#39;m turning into some sort of controversial person for saying the obvious things.<br />
    <br />
    In the morning I was &#34;unprofessional&#34; for telling a troll, who wouldn&#39;t shut up in someone&#39;s Twitter Spaces for ages, to fuck off. <br />
    <br />
    Now I&#39;m a &#34;cyber bully&#34; for not tolerating being yelled at.<br />

    This conversation happened in Twitter Spaces a couple days ago in front of 400 people. Sharing so it&#39;s easier to understand what I have to deal with every other day. <br />

    When I speak in various Twitter Spaces, there&#39;s often someone shouting at me within the first few minutes. I know what I&#39;m talking about so I can speak confidently without having to scream. If you can&#39;t be more composed than me, your hurt feelings are not going to affect me. https://t.co/Fz5vmJxzua<br />

    I&#39;ve been accused over the last few days of inciting violence (ü§£) and &#34;killing all #russianBabies&#34;. People who do that have literally zero clue what kind of person I am so the accusations are a projection of their rich imagination.
