Dear people who claim Denis is not in russia,

I met him online about 10 years ago. Pretty sure he didn't spend the last ten years pretending he was in 🇷🇺 

Sorry he doesn't fit your narrative about both of us. 

I'm not consumed by hatred. And he supports [#visabanforrussians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/visabanforrussians)

    For all the people from recent Spaces, who think I am not really in Russia. Here&#39;s my ugly face trying to kill inner imperialist with smoke next to an easily identifiable location. https://t.co/Cn72Txbs2q<br />
