✍️ Writing is the single most important skill that anyone who wants to tell a story of their community should develop.

💌 It's a constant loop of practicing it 🔄 feedback. 

✅ The main rule that I intuitively abide to, as cliché as it sounds - is authentic communication.

    What skills do you have that you&#39;d be willing to contribute to telling the story of your community? Would you?<br />

When I write huge 🧵s, I never draft them in advance. 

🤬 If I'm angry - I let myself be angry and write in that state.

💔 That stream of consciousness in the moment only has a response from the people reading it because they can sense that emotion in what I say.

    1/ Ukrainians don&#39;t complain much but I hope they don&#39;t mind me saying this: I speak 4 languages and none of them has words that can describe how much it hurts to be one of us these days. <br />
    <br />
    Each of us has been in agony from 1000s propaganda cuts. Literally, lie on a lie on a lie.<br />

Another crucially important thing is keeping it personal - not reducing the damage to the number of casualties.

❌ It's not just "X people died on this day in Odesa." 

❗️It's my loved ones that russians launch cruise missiles at in their HOMES.

And yes, I hate russians. Not all of them, but I'm under no obligation to be looking for 🦄 at the moment. 

❓Ask yourself: wouldn't you hate them right now?

❓Would you be worrying about "russophobia" while being killed in your home? 

No fucking way.

    13/ Last but not least @brokenpixelua video where he explains why Ukrainians shouldn&#39;t listen about &#34;russophobia&#34;, and russian people being &#34;victims&#34; or god forbid &#34;heroes&#34;.<br />
    <br />
    &#34;It&#39;s too late to be a hero.&#34; <br />

    1/ Hey @NikaMelkozerova, making you a whole 🧵 about why I hate everything russian as a russian speaker born and raised in Eastern Ukraine, why Ukrainians have the right to hate and why no one has the right to lecture us about how we should feel. I hope you find it helpful. https://t.co/4bRfhlSUVC<br />
