This is beautiful, thanks for the high praise for my work, [@CalinIonescu5](https://twitter.com/CalinIonescu5) ❤️ The reason why [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) is happening is actually partially can be attributed to people like you bleating about russophobia: [twitter.com/cryptodrftng/s…](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1532479143534813215?s=21&t=jpvM5QLLWZWCPpMWYVUwow)

✨ [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) is accepting donations - [ukraine-dao.notion.site: Multisig & Treasury - UkraineDAO.eth](https://ukraine-dao.notion.site/Multisig-Treasury-UkraineDAO-eth-b080b59f794848fa8f6ac1b22575792c)

❗️We are currently focused on info war. If Ukraine loses it, no donations will help us.

"Let's eject everything russian from history and from the libraries" - yes. I think it's a great initiative. Also, if you look for "russian" stuff that wasn't stolen by russians from other cultures, there isn't gonna be much left to eject so not a huge loss at all 😂

I think there's a bit of misunderstanding here - I never said I wouldn't mind to see Moscow burning! 

I would LOVE to see it burning 💞 "Wouldn't mind" is an understatement. 

🔥 Another option, that doesn't require it burning to the ground - [twitter.com/cryptodrftng/s…](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1535377348761202690?s=21&t=xte1kxYUSAoLviA9EjHohA)

Also, Moscow People's Republic has the right to independence and if their separatists want to be annexed by Ukraine - we'll consider their application as we are peaceful people ✊

For clarity on russian children, russian babies etc etc, repeating again - I do not give a flying fuck about them. What's so hard to understand? I don't incite any violence, I just literally do not care about what happens with them.  At all.

    Recently I said that I consider russians who don&#39;t actively fight against #GenocideOfUkrainians complicit and was accused of not caring about the innocent 🇷🇺 babies (btw, don&#39;t care about them whatsoever).

Not sure if the "satrap" is meant to insult me, but I'm very proud of my rural upbringing. I talked about it a bit here - [cryptodrftng.substack.com: Day 31 - cryptodrftng.](https://cryptodrftng.substack.com/p/day-31?s=r)

I spent a lot of time Ukrainian villagers as a child - they're absolutely beautiful ❤️
