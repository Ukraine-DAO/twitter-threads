It was a huge honour to speak to [@ghappour](https://twitter.com/ghappour) today - I’m a massive fan of his work on the Guantanmo detainees cases. I had no idea he also worked as one of the counsels on [@RealRossU](https://twitter.com/RealRossU) case with his law clinic. He also has a great project focusing on privacy - [@nymproject](https://twitter.com/nymproject)

I’m sometimes asked if I’m ashamed of working to help free Ross Ulbricht from prison. Helping Ross is a privilege I had before russia started full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Why doing that was important - in this tweet and onwards ⬇️

Injustice in one place creates injustice in another place.

Normalise silence as a response to injustice and before you know it, you wake up in russia.

Reposting this 🧵 with [@brokenpixelua](https://twitter.com/brokenpixelua) video because it’s important and urgent to [#ArmUkraineNow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArmUkraineNow) [#StandWithUkraine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/StandWithUkraine)

    1/ This has to be heard by everyone. <br />
    <br />
    🇷🇺 sends to 🇺🇦 the people whose deaths it doesn&#39;t mind - in 🇷🇺 culture that&#39;s pretty much anyone. They don&#39;t value human life.<br />
    <br />
    Meanwhile, 🇺🇦 sacrifices its most precious people. We lost @ratushnyi_r a few days ago.<br />

The idea to have this conversation came from [@nikkijacoutot](https://twitter.com/nikkijacoutot) - thank you, Nikki!
I wasn’t sure [@CyberF0x_](https://twitter.com/CyberF0x_) would be up for it and very grateful that she agreed - I can’t imagine what she is going through but know from personal experience what it takes to be vulnerable in public.

    Thank you to everyone who joined us with @ghappour from @nymproject tonight. <br />
    <br />
    🎙 Next conversation:<br />
    <br />
    @CyberF0x_ is 🇺🇦, based in NYC and an early supporter of our DAO. We’ll talk about her friend who got kidnapped by ruscists in Kherson - on her birthday.<br />
