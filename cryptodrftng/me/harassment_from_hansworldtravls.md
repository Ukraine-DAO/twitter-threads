When I thought the German dude could not go any lower, he decided to make fun of my health condition🥲

About his "concerns"

✅ Financial Transparency: [ukraine-dao.notion.site: Multisig & Treasury - UkraineDAO.eth](https://ukraine-dao.notion.site/Multisig-Treasury-UkraineDAO-eth-b080b59f794848fa8f6ac1b22575792c)

✅ Verified personal history: [cryptodrftng.substack.com: Day 31 - cryptodrftng.](https://cryptodrftng.substack.com/p/day-31?s=r)

😂 "Board of directors" & Legal registration - we don't need it but nice try: [ukraine-dao.notion.site: DAO - Decentralized Autonomous Organization](https://ukraine-dao.notion.site/DAO-Decentralized-Autonomous-Organization-984bb2d0789b44369e7332ca9a8cbe74)

I'm paid a fix amount of 5k USD per month to cover my rent and bills, which was organised by our co-founder [@DefiHope](https://twitter.com/DefiHope) when he realised I wasn't paid by anyone else. The team voted on it with zero involvement from me (I was telling Steve to fuck off and not distract me😂)

Please report [@HansWorldTravls](https://twitter.com/HansWorldTravls) [@UkrainesGrains](https://twitter.com/UkrainesGrains) accounts for targeted harrassment. He needs to sober up a bit ❤️

    @cryptodrftng @HansWorldTravls @UkrainesGrains holy shit. This dude has no shame. Do the organizations he&#39;s working with in Ukraine know about this? He&#39;s a security risk. He would never get a clearance in the US!!! This cost me $5 BTW 🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/E0SIUveNI3<br />

    @cryptodrftng @UkrainesGrains Who&#39;s responsible for murder, rape, extortion, war crimes, genocide in Ukraine?<br />
    <br />
    As expected, no connections between an American getting a DUI &amp; a second genocide in Ukraine, even when we add alcohol into the search.<br />
    <br />
    Some German guys looked into it⬇️<br />

    A message from &#34;claimed founder of Ukraine DAO that only exists on Twitter&#34;<br />
    Recorded in a language that this &#34;supporter of 🇺🇦&#34; doesn&#39;t understand because he only found 🇺🇦 on the map a few months ago, but TLDR:<br />

Neither am I actually, I barely know anything about them😂 The NFT side of the project was handled by my friends from [@TrippyLabs](https://twitter.com/TrippyLabs) who are super knowledgeable about how to make and market them

    @HansWorldTravls @cryptodrftng I don’t care if it is a DAO , Crypto , or a bake sale with the money wired to Ukraine , In the end they raised real money that went to legit Ukrainian organizations that bought real non legal aid that saved real ukranian lives. I’m not a NFT fanboy  but whatever works<br />
