✨The biggest struggle for me has been people not hearing what I say

✨For a number of reasons (arrogance, ignorance, I'm a girl) they make a false assumption that I'm as stupid as them and so present no danger

To illustrate - my post from 25 Jan, weeks before the invasion

✨On this photo - me protesting in Brighton, December 2013. I didn't have any 🇺🇦 friends who could join me so I made that placard and stood at Churchill Square on my own - because people back in Kyiv were fighting oppression. I have a sense of loyalty to them so I'm standing too.

✨Jan 2014, I briefly come back to 🇺🇦 & go to Maidan - epicentre the of Revolution of Dignity
 
Pro-🇷🇺 outlets will call it "a 🇺🇸-supported insurgency against a legitimately elected 🇺🇦 government of  Yanukovych" - [twitter.com/cryptodrftng/s…](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1533640284013223937?s=21&t=BUVACybGLN29FXSMt8elCA)

All I have to say to them - fuck you.

    <br />
    &#34;In 2014, the United States supported an insurgency - a violent insurgency in its final phase - against the legitimately elected Ukrainian government of Viktor Yanukovych, which was pro-Russian.&#34;<br />

✨See these raspberries?

These are the ones that in July of 2014 I'd grow in my parents' vegetable garden, take them to the local market, sell them to resellers and then send the proceeds to ЗСУ or soldiers wounded while defending 🇺🇦 from 🇷🇺 invasion.

✨This is a only business card I've carried since 2014

✨I don't brag about all the things I did to PREVENT this from happening in the first place 

✨You'll never hear about 99% of the things I did - I don't use Ukraine for self-promotion like some FSB assets (example-

    1/ I&#39;ve been trying to tell people since 2014. Here is a slide from my presentation in 2015. Back then, it was a crazy accusation in 🇬🇧 to say that 🇷🇺 is becoming a fascist state. I was a 20yo from a rural area in Ukraine with no platform whatsoever. 🧵- https://t.co/7I03pwPDJg https://t.co/E4V0uGmoNT https://t.co/gTwLB8GHFp<br />

✨Now, every day I feel GUILT about not having managed to prevent my own nation's genocide
❗️If someone on this platform has so little emotional intelligence that they tell me:
- how I should feel
- about "good russians" out there

❗️Sorry but there is a problem with them, not me

    1/ Spoke to a psychologist specialising in trauma and she said “it must have been a huge shock for you what happened”. To me, one of the most distressing aspects of this situation was that I saw this coming from day 1 in 2014 and tried to alarm others the whole time. #Ukraine https://t.co/HodKbA3mrO<br />

🚨Even in this incident 👇 most people policed whether I took it "too far" with Nadya from [@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot) - the hurt ego of a russian celebrity is more important than the life of a Ukrainian whose life she is trying to destroy.

❓Has everyone gone mad or what, I don't understand?

❗️ I keep asking myself these simple questions, and you know, I don't have good answers to them.

🚨All I see every day is elaborate mental gymnatics for why abuse of Ukrainians is justified during genocide. 

It's fucking sickening and I'm tired of dealing with this every day.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    Simple questions:<br />
    <br />
    1) If everything was the other way around and Ukrainians were committing genocide in russia, would anyone be worrying about saving our face and not humiliating us? <br />
    <br />
    2) Why is their imaginary suffering more important than our real one?<br />

❓What angers me the most about all of this?

❗️The fact that by all the morons who belittle me in public, send abuse in DMs and make fun of me, by the time they realise how wrong they were - most of the people and places I loved in this life will be erased from existence.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    ❗This is an extremely important point.<br />
    <br />
    ❗The reason why russians are committing genocide now with zero shame is because they got away with it last time.<br />
    <br />
    ❗People who silence us or shame Ukrainians for being angry should realise one simple thing - you are helping them kill us. https://t.co/W32HXMisMo<br />

I do not know how many times and in what words to repeat:

❗️I AM angry

❗️DO hate everything 🇷🇺

❗️I DO hate people who spread lies about 🇺🇦 thus making this genocide possible 

❓If my posts outrage someone so much, I'm really fucking curious how they would act if they were me?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ Ukrainians don&#39;t complain much but I hope they don&#39;t mind me saying this: I speak 4 languages and none of them has words that can describe how much it hurts to be one of us these days. <br />
    <br />
    Each of us has been in agony from 1000s propaganda cuts. Literally, lie on a lie on a lie.<br />
