[@Bunnyrabert](https://twitter.com/Bunnyrabert) you don't realise how hilarious this is 🤣

The only time I EVER cried in front of my colleagues when I worked in litigation was when I did a 23andMe test and it identified me as likely 🇷🇺 (they since updated the database to include 🇺🇦 as equally likely🤣🤣)

For comparison, I didn't cry that much in March 2020 when I realised I was going to be insulin-dependent for the rest of my life 

Being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes I could somehow cope with, but being diagnosed as russian is too much to handle, sorry

    1/ In March 2020, just as the pandemic was hitting the UK where I&#39;m based, I was diagnosed with #type1diabetes which is an incurable autoimmune disorder that requires extremely complex care. Exhausted rn but will later post about life with a disability in this 🧵 https://t.co/xdbLpJdyTN https://t.co/p0CNLvx2yH<br />
