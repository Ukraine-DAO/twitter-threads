‚ú®Afterparty on last day of [@eth_barcelona](https://twitter.com/eth_barcelona). I dressed up, put makeup on and just sat there working all night.

    @cryptodrftng @tiinakatariina &#34;the Ukrainian lady... deep in the midst of a genocide... slowly approaches the western men, who themselves believe strongly that they know what&#39;s best for everyone... they quickly realise they have been outwitted - some of them run, some attack..&#34;<br />
