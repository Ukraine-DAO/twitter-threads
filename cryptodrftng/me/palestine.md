I’m always baffled when Ukrainians are told “but you didn’t care about 🇵🇸 when it needed help”

1) not appropriate at all atm

2) almost never said by people who are actually from 🇵🇸 - all my friends from there are super supportive 

3) can’t talk for others, but I did care [pic.twitter.com/zAkK2wTJRe](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1537747654741999619/video/1)

    Here&#39;s a photo of my dog Sasha at a protest in Palestine&#39;s support, June 2020. We also went to lots of BLM protests as well as ones against Lukashenko&#39;s regime. Please don&#39;t tell Ukrainians your &#34;whatabouts&#34;, Ukraine is not an imperialist power and never attacked any country. https://t.co/hD4Uas0sCm<br />

I didn’t have any friends from there at that time. When you see something fucked up happening - don’t ignore it. Doesn’t matter if it’s not your country 

P.S. S/o to one of my friends who has family in 🇮🇱 but still looked after Sasha when there was a particularly big protest😂
