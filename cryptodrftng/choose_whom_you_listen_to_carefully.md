    10/ But the real heroes in this story are the Ukrainian people. Their unity and a sense of dignity still amaze me every day. <br />
    <br />
    Each and every Ukrainian had to become a fighter - different frontlines for each of us. <br />
    <br />
    We are under attack from every front. <br />
    <br />
    But we are together ❤️ https://t.co/nWywtcQvib<br />

    18/ Now, THIS is actually a fucking pisstake. <br />
    <br />
    To turn #GenocideOfUkrainians into a &#34;Pussyverse&#34; ad - you have to be messed up on another level.<br />
    <br />
    You didn&#39;t start @Ukraine_DAO with a number of friends, Nadya.<br />

    I started it on 21 Feb with my friends. <br />
