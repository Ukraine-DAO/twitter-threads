    1/ The most ridiculous example in my experience is Allan Ripp: https://t.co/Oeft1PHpVa<br />
    <br />
    He wrote this absolute nonsense for @NBCNewsTHINK. When I reached out to him asking to explain, he told me that there is actually a much longer version of the article and he can send it to me. https://t.co/VixHVrdVWY https://t.co/cEHAJ5t55M<br />

Forgot to say - [@GuyReuters](https://twitter.com/GuyReuters)  responded to me:

"tHiS iS My sToRy" what a clown. He is the most despicable man I've heard of in my life. putin and the war crimes that ruscists committed in 🇺🇦 would not be possible without dickheads like him in the West. [#ReutersLies](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ReutersLies)

    Send that nonsense to @reuters lawyers, you disgraceful bitch. They&#39;ll need it.<br />
    <br />
    &#34;...🇷🇺 officials do not use the words war or invasion, saying it is a &#34;special military operation&#34; aimed at preventing the persecution of 🇷🇺 speakers in eastern Ukraine.&#34; 🤡 @guyreuters #ReutersLies https://t.co/kIcdI3WKOF<br />

    @OzKaterji At least he managed to visit a real front line and not only restaurants in a very city center of Kyiv and a maybe a couple areas where dramatic pictures  for Twitter can be taken. Following you, Oz, I realized that you actually good in pretending and just a banal careerist.<br />

I'm not a journalist by have this useful reference material for "journalists" covering Ukraine these days. I can't imagine how sick and tired [@brokenpixelua](https://twitter.com/brokenpixelua) is being called a fascist, he's actually super patient considering what he's been through.

    @OzKaterji @Gabrielanseo @replytomorons It is about you sharing post where I , personally, and my folks called a “fascist militia”. That’s fucking problem, man. Aris fucked up with his tweet. Why you involved “Ukrainian fascist” in it?<br />

    1/ So let me make sure I got this right:<br />
    <br />
    1) @snopes call themselves &#34;fact-checkers&#34; ? <br />
    <br />
    2) The author, Bethania Palma, is a &#34;journalist&#34;? <br />
    <br />
    Is that supposed to be correct? https://t.co/hXQlAAVcZt https://t.co/F2Hsoc3aVZ<br />
