I know this is a "controversial" subject for many people and the reason for that is that ruscists were putting a lot of 💰 and effort into information attacks against Azov. Fuck them.

⚡️When you hear someone sharing incorrect information about them - speak out. 

If the people you're speaking to are incapable of taking in new information and are so arrogant that they think they know better than 🇺🇦 people - send them my thoughts and prayers 🕊

Going back to info attacks - I personally really don't like it when people trying to defend Azov in public start from saying "every country has its own far-right people".

❌ This is the wrong place to start from - it legitimises the false accusations.

“Thanks to Azov, 🇺🇦 has emerged as a new hub for the transnational far-right”
“What’s clear is this: Azov is certainly a key node in a global far-right extremist network, one that includes sympathizers and even perpetrators of far-right terrorism.”
