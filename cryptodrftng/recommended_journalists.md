I got you, [@francesblackma6](https://twitter.com/francesblackma6). No need to miss the old war correspondents - I can recommend a few people :) 

@chrisocchicone - excellent photojournalist, has been covering Ukraine since 2014. I asked him how many "Ukrainian Nazis" he met there. He saw 1 (!) far-right person.

    @cryptodrftng @snopes I’m always inclined to believe in the individual who is actually experiencing what it’s like fighting on the front over the journalists who nowadays are just about the ‘story’ and what they can get out of it. I miss the old war correspondents who reported facts from the front.<br />

He is also a must follow himself btw ❤️🖤 [twitter.com/maksymeristavi…](https://twitter.com/maksymeristavi/status/1538157332076679168)

The reason why I'm being silenced is not just a gender issue. 
❗️All Ukrainians, including males, are silenced and abused in public every day. 
❗️Those involved in defence of 🇺🇦 deserve respect and recognition. Defence includes info support - [@ZeroZhvk](https://twitter.com/ZeroZhvk) & fundraising - [@revrfg](https://twitter.com/revrfg)

    &#34;I am a man, but I&#39;m not holding a machine gun in my hands and am not defending Ukraine at the frontline<br />
    I don&#39;t feel brave but I&#39;m full of RAGE which I transform into work for Ukraine&#39;s benefit, in whatever way I can and as bravely as I can&#34;<br />

And for the love of god, don't consume RU media. 

"russian independent media" is an oxymoron. It doesn't exist. 

[@meduza_en](https://twitter.com/meduza_en) is particularly shit.
