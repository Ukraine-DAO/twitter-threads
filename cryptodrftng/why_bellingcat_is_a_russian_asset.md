🚨Why is Bellingcat on [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) Foreign Assets List?

Before I address this question: 

❓Forgive my ignorance but was imaginary Jewish "extremism" studied during the Holocaust too?

❓Are Ukrainians more dangerous than russians killing them?

🇷🇺 says so called "🇺🇦 Nazis" are persecuting russian speakers in Eastern Ukraine

I was born and raised there. 

I speak svynosobacha on a native level. 

Never seen any "🇺🇦 Nazis" and not scared of them tbh

But the russian ones are currently trying to kill my loved ones

I'll start from saying that the only real neo-Nazi problem in Ukraine is russians

Dear [@bellingcat](https://twitter.com/bellingcat), professional investigative journalists should focus on the actual [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians), russian Nazis of Rusich or the Russian Imperial Movement 👇

I want to remind everyone, that Ukrainians are currently being SLAUGHTERED. 

Therefore, if I am now hurting someone's feelings or ego by calling out the lies that have made our suffering possible - I have no problem with that whatsoever.

I know that [@bellingcat](https://twitter.com/bellingcat) is a highly regarded group. 

The fact that people trust what they say about Azov makes it a million times worse. 

In case they struggle with basic fact checking or haven't been to Ukraine, I will help here a little bit. 

[cup.columbia.edu: From the Fires of War | Columbia University Press](http://cup.columbia.edu/book/from-the-fires-of-war/9783838215082)

Let's imagine you don't like the symbols Azov Regiment use. 

❗️If you're a journalist, and you witness the genocide in Ukraine - Ukrainians being tortured and killed by russians, but you choose to focus on Azov's symbols, I'd recommend looking for another job.

Seriously.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

    3/ What Azov is:<br />
    ✅ a highly professional military unit playing crucial part in resisting the 🇷🇺 genocidal aggression. <br />
    ✅ includes ethnic 🇺🇦, 🇷🇺, 🇧🇾, 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿, 🇬🇷 &amp; Ukrainian patriots of all backgrounds <br />
    <br />
    What Azov ISN&#39;T:<br />
    ❌ political organisation <br />

According to [@bellingcat](https://twitter.com/bellingcat), Olena (on the left on the photo with me) is the "First Lady of 🇺🇦 Nationalism" 

I've been *actually* studying this war since the first days in 2014 to this day.

Olena is presented as a dangerous person, but actual 🇷🇺 Nazis aren't - it's laughable.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    One of my favourite things about my visit to Ukraine was meeting Azov representatives. <br />
    <br />
    Olena and Nikita are absolutely amazing and I can&#39;t imagine what they&#39;ve been going through with constant 🇷🇺 info attacks - on top of all the grief ❤️‍🩹<br />

I'm not saying that [@bellingcat](https://twitter.com/bellingcat) are bad people, BTW. I don't know. 

All I'm saying is that if they lived during WWII and were releasing books about how dangerous Jewish people were, during the Holocaust, their work wouldn't age very well.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ Quick rule of thumb for &#34;experts&#34;: before saying something about Ukrainians and russian Nazis, replace them in the same sentence with &#34;Jewish people&#34; and &#34;German Nazis&#34; and consider if you&#39;d say that in public. If you wouldn&#39;t, then it&#39;s not appropriate. You&#39;re welcome. 🙂<br />

Now breaking news for all the people who have never been to 🇺🇦 but want to educate me about Ukrainian extremism with links, photos and other products of RU propaganda and give me "context":

❗️I'm from there, guys so I really don't need your "context".

Here's better information about Azov. Please don't tell me about how amazing [@bellingcat](https://twitter.com/bellingcat) are with other stuff.

❗️It's on THEM to correct the false information.

❗️We should NOT put up with our defenders not getting help because of lies in the media

[ukraine-dao.notion.site: #SaveAzov](https://ukraine-dao.notion.site/SaveAzov-c3349aa74a7d470b866b134606bc46b4)

For [@bellingcat](https://twitter.com/bellingcat), [@ColborneMichael](https://twitter.com/ColborneMichael) and anyone else who doesn't understand why all of this is so important:

❗️Disinformation is a weapon
 
❗️That weapon has made this war possible 

❗️If this isn't stopped, everything I love is erased out of existence through awful violence

    1/ Ukrainians don&#39;t complain much but I hope they don&#39;t mind me saying this: I speak 4 languages and none of them has words that can describe how much it hurts to be one of us these days. <br />

    Each of us has been in agony from 1000s propaganda cuts. Literally, lie on a lie on a lie.<br />

I'll be VERY grateful if non-🇺🇦 people avoid giving me advice I didn't ask for.

I know, it's a wild thought that a 🇺🇦 person can actually know more about Ukraine than someone who's never been there 🤯

I'm under no obligation to listen to your opinion 🤯

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ Recently I&#39;ve been receiving a lot of unsolicited advice. I know that the vast majority of people giving that advice meant well and they thought they were helping me. My issue with it is that it&#39;s often repetitive, even more often - ignorant and in some cases - insulting.<br />

If after reading this 🧵 you feel the sudden urge to westplain why I'm wrong, here's a good way to cope:

✅ assume I may know something you don't (🤯) 

✅ explore this page to educate yourself about Ukraine, 🇷🇺 propaganda and many other things

[ukraine-dao.notion.site: Cryptodrftng Threads](https://ukraine-dao.notion.site/Cryptodrftng-Threads-2ff0858a3dc64c7a8a793b4fa659ef20)

[@ResidentMemer](https://twitter.com/ResidentMemer) why are you surprised that I didn't waste time reading [@ColborneMichael](https://twitter.com/ColborneMichael) book if you can't even finish a 🧵 by a much more competent person?

Lies about Azov are extremely dumb and repetitive. 

If I wanted some good phantasy, I'd go for Tolkien instead.

The genocide in Ukraine is happening right now because Ukrainians were not heard. 

A lot of coverage of 🇺🇦 by foreign "journalists" has been actual fiction. 

Continuing to not hear us and belittling our perspectives is appalling.

    Guys, if something is not true, it&#39;s not true. It doesn&#39;t become true if it&#39;s published by Bellingcat.<br />

    Ukrainians happen to know a bit more about the situation in 🇺🇦 than many people in the West presenting themselves as &#34;experts&#34;🤯<br />
    <br />
    Not understanding that is the real &#34;wild take&#34; https://t.co/uKzXB6u4GW<br />

    Once again, remind you that Leonid Ragozin is a Russian Ukrainephobe who exists in public space only because guys from Bellingcat support his ass. Why?
