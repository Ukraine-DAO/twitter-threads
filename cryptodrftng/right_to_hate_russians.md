"Good russians" (🦄) outraged by their rights being "violated" during [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) is a GREAT illustration of the amount of fucks they really give - 0️⃣

Their "empathy" ends the moment accountability begins.

    I really don&#39;t get it.<br />
    <br />
    1. Daily stories about the most horrific atrocities by Russians in Ukraine.<br />
    <br />
    2. Boorish, sometimes even murderous behavior by Russian tourists in Europe.<br />
    <br />
    ...and then these whingy takes on &#34;poor Russians, if they don&#39;t get visas they will suffer.&#34;<br />

✨ By the way, expecting a Ukrainian person to feel sorry for russians' travel rights is an actual pisstake. 

Analogy:

"There may be some good people in ISIS. 

Let's not humiliate ISIS. 

ISIS is a superpower.

Hatred for ISIS is not the way."

Have people gone mad?

    Committing genocide means people at fault - russians - have to be held accountable.&#34;<br />

❗️Deliberate neglect is standing by while something awful happens and doing little or nothing to stop it.

❗️War is a collective exercise by a nation state. 

❗️All russians are responsible. 

❗️You don't just get to have rights. 

❗️There are also responsibilities 🤯

    I also recommend to read this book. Lots of insights for people worrying about poor russians who have no idea what&#39;s happening and would do something if they could. https://t.co/aMon3b6RlG https://t.co/bF3CyBHVmx<br />
