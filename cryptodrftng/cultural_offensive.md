    This interview should be translated into English. In it, a director of Russian Hermitage museum calls himself &#39;a militarist&#39; and &#39;an imperialist&#39; and outlines how Russia uses its culture as a weapon, in Ukraine and abroad https://t.co/Doa6SZBnr0<br />

    8/ &#34;Crime and Punishment&#34; is literally about a young loser who hasn&#39;t achieved anything in life killing an old woman and stealing her purse. Reminds you of anything? <br />
    <br />
    Sorry to break it to you, but Ukranian literature has much cooler stuff to read 🤯 I know, shocking stuff!<br />

[@MuKappa](https://twitter.com/MuKappa) made TLDR of the interview:

✨ russia has superior culture and should not fear “cancellation.” For that reason 🇷🇺 should not worry about cancelling western cultures

✨ russia has to continue special cultural operations; it has to continue the cultural offensive

✨ 🇷🇺 must shape the European cultural model by itself. Europe is no longer Europe. russia is Europe.

✨ russia if free to absorb and assimilate other cultures, as it is the guardian of world culture.

✨ It is a moral imperative of each russian to be with their country and broadcast the russian culture beyond the ring of blockade.

✨ “Do what [you] must and come what may” and each russian must be with russia, no matter what the country does.

    &#34;After February 24, I made a firm decision never again to publish a single text in Russian. I do not want to be understood by those beasts who are murdering Ukrainian children.&#34;<br />
