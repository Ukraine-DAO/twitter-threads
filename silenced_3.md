This is a HUGE problem and that's why I kicked off the other day when I saw a üßµ about journalists covering üá∫üá¶ that had 0 (!) Ukrainians on it but included [@ChristopherJM](https://twitter.com/ChristopherJM). Ukrainians apparently "tend to write and speak with the bias of those who are being oppressed and invaded".

    @skykiss22 @cryptodrftng @MrTopple @bywirenews @jacobin @PeterJHowson @NorthumbriaUni @skykiss22 @cryptodrftng consider the amount of times he refers to countries in the text:<br />
    1.) Russia: 37 times, 2.) United States: 24 times, 3.) Ukraine: 20 times, 4.) NATO: 19 times. It‚Äôs not an a accident. He doesn‚Äôt see Ukraine as a principal in the war with agency &amp; rights.<br />

Imagine saying "Black people are not entitled to speak up against racism - they have the bias of those who are being oppressed". That's exactly how insane that sounds to Ukrainians.

    @cryptodrftng Amplifying the OP. As a mathematical point, sources of evidence are nearly always biased. It is a huge blunder to dismiss evidence just cuz it comes from a biased source. TL;DR If you dismiss Ukrainian sources because of bias, apologize for your ignorance and learn Bayes theorem<br />
