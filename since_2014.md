# One of main reasons for what's happening in Ukraine right now is the weak response to the russian aggression back in 2014

Spoke to a psychologist specialising in trauma and she said ‚Äúit must have been a huge shock for you what happened‚Äù. To me, one of the most distressing aspects of this situation was that I saw this coming from day 1 in 2014 and tried to alarm others the whole time. [#Ukraine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ukraine)

That slide above from a talk I gave in 2015 said ‚ÄúLet me control the media and I will turn any nation into a herd of pigs‚Äù -Goebbels. I was trying to explain to people how information was weaponised and how dangerous it was. I said this was the real new Nazism rising.

Here are some slides from it. I was just a kid back then so no one took it seriously. And now I‚Äôm watching the consequences, in absolute despair and horror. That price of the world opening its eyes too late is being paid by everyone around me right now. üíî [#Ukraine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ukraine)

This is why it was so annoying to me to see people celebrating when [#Putin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Putin) said he was withdrawing troops. I know how that pathetic creature operates, he doesn‚Äôt have the decency in him to say one word of truth. If he ANNOUNCES he is withdrawing troops - prepare for an ATTACK.

Now as I watch all this horror unfold, the most painful thing is that doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúshock‚Äù me. It‚Äôs an expected result of something could‚Äôve been prevented by ordinary people speaking up, but it wasn‚Äôt because they thought their voice didn‚Äôt matter or they were scared.
