‚ö°Ô∏èPreparing a material about the largest russian propaganda news agency - [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) 

I have substantial amount of evidence but will be grateful for additional info üíÖ 

Please share the truth about who they are with others instead of their üá∑üá∫ propaganda.

I was wondering if they would stop spreading [#russianLies](https://twitter.com/hashtag/russianLies) about Ukraine after the genocidal invasion started. Not even that stopped them. 

Here's one of my favourite examples of [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) "journalism" üëè

This is what [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) had the audacity to publish when Azov's heroes who showed superhuman courage and resilience while defending Mariupol in inhumane conditions ended up in ruscists hands.

Btw, [@New_Narrative](https://twitter.com/New_Narrative), that article should be titled "Nonsense about Azov Regiment".

Huge thank you to [@mhmck](https://twitter.com/mhmck) for stating the obvious. I'm amazed by how many people are not aware of [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) being a rascist propaganda platform even though all the evidence is right there, in plain sight.

    But it‚Äôs worse than that. Reuters amplifies Russian propaganda and falsifies the truth of events. People die because of the perfidy of Reuters. https://t.co/VWxKA7K5kt<br />

The [@politico](https://twitter.com/politico) article I just mentioned in WR. [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) 
[Reuters staff raise alarms over partnership with Russian-owned wire service](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/20/reuters-staff-partnership-russian-wire-service-00018779)

I am aware of this statement they made,  but unless 
[@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters)
 stops to spread russian propaganda there's no reason to consider Reuters aren't compromised anymore. 

Their continued spread of lies is testimony to that.

As [@saver_ag](https://twitter.com/saver_ag) highlighted, [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) misspelled  "russian invasion" which is very unfortunate. russia is only mentioned in passing for some reason.
Also, there is no "crisis". Crisis is what [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) are having - integrity crisis.

    Repeating again, for @Reuters and other #Russia propaganda puppets: I speak both Russian &amp; Ukrainian as my native languages. All I - and other Russian-speaking people in Eastern Ukraine - have for the Kremlin regime is contempt. #Ukraine https://t.co/tHaYNJ9PKS<br />

Dear [@AFP](https://twitter.com/AFP), [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) etc - there are no "separatists" in Ukraine, repeating again: [twitter.com/cryptodrftng/s‚Ä¶](https://twitter.com/cryptodrftng/status/1521028424105697280)

 These are terrorists "imported" to Ukraine from russia, not sure what [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) journalists were doing in the car with them.

    #UPDATE The Reuters news agency said Friday that two of its journalists were wounded and their driver killed while en route to Severodonetsk<br />
     <br />
    The agency added that their vehicle was provided by Russian-backed separatists and driven by an individual assigned by the separatists<br />

Meanwhile [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) continues to legitimise a genocidal country looting Ukrainian grain.

This is some the lowest I've seen "journalists" go and I've watched RU propaganda for years. 

[@tuvangumrukcu](https://twitter.com/tuvangumrukcu) [@Orhan__Coskun](https://twitter.com/Orhan__Coskun) are you proud of yourselves?
