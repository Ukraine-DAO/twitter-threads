üßµüö®I call on all media outlets globally - local, regional, national, to immediately drop ALL syndicated content from [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) - it is an active propaganda arm of the Kremlin. Please do not be complicit. Stop funding [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) through syndication license fees. Share & Tag media.

"Through its news agency distribution network, [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) reaches over 2,000 publishers and 600 broadcasters each day, who in turn distribute our content to billions of people around the world."
[Content Distribution Services | Reuters News Agency](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/services/reuters-plus-content-studio/content-distribution)

This is not a singular instance. You will find thousands of [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) articles like this credited to their various journalists over years. Read by billions around the world.

[@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) also has demonstrated a pattern of "silent edits." They first blast verbatim Kremlin propaganda to syndication partners, then they edit their own articles to dilute it a little bit. Those edits often aren't even picked up by media partners. Very strategic & conniving.

More background here. Again, you will find THOUSANDS of [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) articles that are verbatim Kremlin propaganda. Read by billions around the world, as coming from a "reputable Western media entity."

Here's a classic one. Since the start of the invasion, [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) has gone a step further to actively disinform the West about the atrocities in Ukraine.

[@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) stopped syndicating TASS (Cyrillic-letter abbreviation for Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union) since this article came out. That's irrelevant because [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) is much more effective at spreading Kremlin propaganda as a Western entity.
[Reuters staff raise alarms over partnership with Russian-owned wire service](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/20/reuters-staff-partnership-russian-wire-service-00018779)

Also, need to apply public pressure on the "Big 3" client groups that pay [@thomsonreuters](https://twitter.com/thomsonreuters) that make up the bulk of billions in revenue to stop their service subscriptions immediately.

We are supporting Putin's fascist regime and genocide of Ukrainians by funding [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters). Reuters had an impeccable reputation since 1851, until some years ago when it all changed. Investigative journalists who've covered this know all this & more. This isn't some bombshell

WHAT YOU CAN DO: As individuals - we can cancel our $35/month [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) subscriptions and one suggestion would be to use that subscription money to support our local news organizations that employ or are trying to employ investigative journalists. ‚úä

[@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) March 30th: Putin is the real hero -
"Drone video captured exclusively by Reuters on March 24 shows besieged Mariupol residents in a long queue for humanitarian aid being distributed by Russia at a former shopping center."

YOU DO UNDERSTAND THAT RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT MADE SURE THE "EXCLUSIVE" [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) DRONE CAPTURED THIS PROPAGANDA AND SPREAD THIS STORY IN THE WEST, RIGHT?

More likely scenario though - this was a Russian government propaganda drone. Kremlin handed this messed up video as an "exclusive" to [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) with a wink and a smile. Doubtful [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) was anywhere near Mariupol. [Reuters delivers exclusive drone footage showing devastation in Mariupol - Reuters News Agency](https://bit.ly/3xDMdqj)

[@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) claims the party responsible for shelling and destroying 95%+ of buildings in Mariupol is "Russian-Ukrainian conflict."

Direct Quote: "... as civilians were trying to leave the city heavy damaged by shelling during Russian-Ukrainian conflict."

Remember this completely fake "Exclusive" headline that shocked Americans? [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) has been doing the Kremlin's bidding in destabilizing American society. Kremlin actively facilitated the Jan 6th terrorist attack on the Capitol. [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) gave Putin cover.
