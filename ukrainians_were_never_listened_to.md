Looked through my camera roll from the weeks preceding the full scale invasion on 24th February. This was posted on my Insta stories on the 20th Feb. One day later, [@Ukraine_DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) was born.

I am Ukrainian and even though I've lived in the UK the last few years, my whole family is in Ukraine, and so are most of my friends. I'd also worried that this was going to happen for years because of what I was seeing in russian fake news.

Also, defence of the Motherland and its integrity is a duty of every üá∫üá¶ citizen, Article 65 of the Constitution. I don't see it as heroic - you either do what you can to stop russia or everyone you love dies. We all have been doing impossible things to help defend üá∫üá¶

The biggest heartbreak for me personally was that we knew this was going to happen. We could see it very clearly. We were trying to tell everyone. And even now, as [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) is happening AGAIN, we are often blamed for it (!)

    1/ Spoke to a psychologist specialising in trauma and she said ‚Äúit must have been a huge shock for you what happened‚Äù. To me, one of the most distressing aspects of this situation was that I saw this coming from day 1 in 2014 and tried to alarm others the whole time. #Ukraine https://t.co/HodKbA3mrO<br />

Look at this. This was in my presentation notes years and years ago. russia openly tells everyone that we shouldn't exist. This is why I have such a strong reaction to journalists writing nonsense about us - their blatant lies are literally killing us.
