Sorry but writing a 🧵 about journalists covering 🇺🇦  without a single  🇺🇦 one is patronising as hell and just wrong on every level. Ukrainians have the experience of dealing with 🇷🇺 that Western experts and journalists are fortunate to not have.

    Finally, it’s not hard from my timeline to assemble Ukrainian voices that should be read and heard, with the caveat that they’re inside the fight, and tend to write and speak with the bias of those who are being oppressed and invaded.<br />

One of the key weapons of russian disinformation campaign is using "experts" whose knowledge of Ukraine is limited to what they know through russian propaganda sources. They are not objective. They are often either clueless or their integrity has been compromised.

Let me illustrate what [@GicAriana](https://twitter.com/GicAriana) means in this tweet. 

Once I came across a 🧵 with the list of best "reporters" covering Ukraine. On the list there isn't a single Ukrainian journalist - because they "speak and write with the bias of those oppressed and invaded". See 1/ ☝️

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    Many western journalists and experts wrote and said all manner of Kremlin favourable stuff against Ukraine. They parroted lies. I challenged them. I got called a “crazy” “Russophobe” “bitch” and worse. I wanted the TRUTH to prevail, not be cozy with liars.<br />
    </p>
    &mdash; <a href="https://twitter.com/GicAriana/status/1560430686326202371">Link</a>
</blockquote>

However, the list has [@ChristopherJM](https://twitter.com/ChristopherJM) on it - absolute charlatan.

I couldn't believe my eyes but thought maybe if I let the author of the 🧵 know that it's what wrong to have [@ChristopherJM](https://twitter.com/ChristopherJM) on that list, he'll reconsider.

Response: "this is my list and I'm sticking by it"

"I don't know who you are" - maybe try looking up "Alona Shevchenko Ukraine DAO" in [Google](http://google.com) so you can find out

*unsolicited advice on where to direct energy*

If an "expert" doesn't understand the damage of spreading lies about 🇺🇦, they need a different job

[@MuKappa](https://twitter.com/MuKappa) and I keep a list with these "experts" and "unbiased sources" - featuring [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters), the biggest 🇷🇺 fake news agency in the world 

Which 🇷🇺 parrots are paid and which ones are being idiots for free is irrelevant - same consequences 
[Foreign Assets - Twitter](https://ukraine-dao.notion.site/Foreign-Assets-Twitter-2225a1f90b474eed83d317729ef68841)

Here’s what happened when I once said in a Twitter Space that [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) spread 🇷🇺 propaganda  - 🧵👇

I started from carefully qualifying my statement first and said that I know there are a lot of excellent journalists and photographers who have contributed to [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ A few people have asked me what happened today, so I&#39;d like to explain. There was a conversation happening in @walter_report Twitter Spaces about @Reuters. <br />
    <br />
    Both me and @gujingc started our comments from saying that we are aware that not all @Reuters journalists are corrupt. https://t.co/oR2xbQe3XG<br />

After I explained why I call [@Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters)  🇷🇺 propaganda and why I say that [#ReutersLies](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ReutersLies), I also had to listen to this 👇

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    3/ One of the gentlemen in the spaces got hella triggered and started shouting at me. I was told that my attitude stinks, that it shouldn&#39;t matter that I&#39;m from Ukraine and all sorts of other inappropriate, tonedeaf things were said.<br />

I’m not entirely sure why we are expected to act with exemplary manners and class during [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) - but we are. 

After this incident many people told me the guy has a “good heart” (?) so I shouldn’t be upset. 

They didn’t give the same energy to calling him out.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    4/ After he finished, I said that it&#39;s completely unacceptable to not be able to control yourself like that in the presence of Ukrainian people who are going through a genocide and that if I manage to maintain composure then he should be able too.<br />
    </p>

I should be able to retrieve the full recording of that conversation soon but here’s what he said when he came back - that was already when he “calmed down”.

Spoiler alert: he shouted at me more.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    @jakmierzejewski @OSINT88 Here&#39;s a clip of him coming back to shout at me more after having already shouted at me for quite a long time. Happy to publish a full recording of that conversation. https://t.co/YsMSQFbe84<br />

Next time I call this guy out, he comes up with “I warmed you too many times” and starts threatening “lEgAL aCtION” 🤣

I’m still waiting to learn - what is it that I was warned about? If someone finds out - please let me know, I’m very curious!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    6/ ✨ I was today years old when I found out about @OSINT88 attempts to warn me <br />
    ✨ Not the best person to be threatened by legal action. I have 2 law degrees with distinction - one from 🇺🇦  and one from 🇬🇧, worked in litigation for years &amp; have a team of lawyers at my disposal😂 https://t.co/6dbYD3YBK8<br />

“Slander” basically means making false (!) statements that damage someone’s reputation, BTW

I’m not sure what from what I’ve said so far would qualify as slander, but maybe the imaginary lawyers of this guy can tell me - I’m still waiting to hear from them🙃

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    7/ I&#39;m a lawyer myself. <br />
    <br />
    Not a single word of what I have said about @OSINT88 qualifies as slander. <br />
    <br />
    Any lawyer who takes a case against a Ukrainian person suffering from abuse online during genocide will completely shatter their reputation.<br />
    <br />
    Nice try though👍 https://t.co/DCzXd0T0nz<br />

Now, interesting turn of events:

❣️After multiple episodes of shouting, absolutely groundless lawsuit threats and my attempts to address all this with him privately - it turns out he is actually the victim here

❣️People in the comments in his account feel awful for him 🙂

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    9/ Imagine having enough audacity to:<br />
    <br />
    ✅ abuse a 🇺🇦 person in public during genocide <br />
    ✅ threaten them with legal action as they defend another 🇺🇦  <br />
    ✅ never apologise for any of the above<br />

Eventually I did hear back from this knowledgable “expert” 👌

❓You think he finally acknowledged what was wrong and apologised (which I would’ve gladly accepted)?
 
❌ He threatened “lEgAL aCtIOn” again and added “You will learn the hard way on all of this.” 🪄

To summarise the tweet below, I still haven’t been sued for not-sure-what by not-sure-who - the “expert” is so “famous” he can’t tell his name🤣

💡I’m also not aware of a jurisdiction where you can sue someone because your small dick energy makes you think you can do that.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    Someone has just asked me if I&#39;ve been sued in the end haha<br />

I’m often told that I’m diverting attention to “myself” from the “real problem”- the war in 🇺🇦

The war in 🇺🇦 would NOT be happening in the first place if the arrogant people in the West listened to us

They didn’t listen in 2014, didn’t listen all these years - and even now.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

People try to rationalise this consistent pattern in various ways - all of them equally ridiculous

❗️“Professional experts”, “unbiased journalists” and Western “bothsideists” who do not listen to us are just doing virtue signalling

🇺🇦 is better off without such “supporters”

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    If someone claims to support 🇺🇦, they have to show basic respect to Ukrainians<br />
    <br />
    ❗️I work 24/7, no days off. Barely leave the house. My loved ones are risking their lives every day - to defend 🇺🇦, which is not a real life Call of Duty game to entertain homegrown &#34;OSINT&#34;  experts. https://t.co/IvbVqNMO3e<br />

❗️Asking a Ukrainian to ignore & tolerate abuse to avoid "drama" is appeasement politics on a mini scale

❗️Why are you surprised that russians are committing all the horrific war crimes if when seeing Ukrainians verbally abused during genocide, you go after Ukrainians?

I’ve been blamed for enjoying a “kooshty life in London”

❗️Genocide isn’t “kooshty”

⚡️Breaking News for “experts”

If you can’t reassess your view when presented with new information, that’s either low intelligence OR you’re an arrogant Westplainer. Possibly both.

Lots of people have been asking to heard the recording of the exchange with the so called "knowledgable expert" [@OSINT88](https://twitter.com/OSINT88) so here it is. 

If we allow this behaviour during [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians), we shouldn't be shocked about that ruscists get away with invading Ukraine.
