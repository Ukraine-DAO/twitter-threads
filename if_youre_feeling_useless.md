Second, [@e_endruweit](https://twitter.com/e_endruweit), for completeness of picture, can Germany also publish the list of weapons sold to russia in violation of embargo on arms sales imposed in 2014?

As I said before, Ukraine receives loads of weapons from Germany.

It just gets into Ukraine from the wrong side - Ukrainians are being killed with the weapons that he helped sell to russia despite the embargo.

Germany undermined Ukraine for decades - as a result üá∫üá¶ is not a member of NATO

üá©üá™ sold arms to russia despite the embargo imposed to 2014

Sorry to say this, but... pretty much anyone is more important than the person who said that to you, [@ndboulton](https://twitter.com/ndboulton) üòπ

    Just saw a sarcastic comment from a German saying &#34;because Ukrainians are more important than our own people...&#34;<br />
    <br />
    Interested now... would you rather live in a world full of Germans, or a world full of Ukrainians right now?<br />

We are very grateful but without Germany those refugees would actually be living back home in Ukraine.  

Before "resisting" fascists in the EU, Germany needs to get rid of its own ones. It's in no position to lecture any other country on anything.

    Actually we are trying to provide home to &#43;/- 1 Million ukrainian refugees.<br />
    Including financial support, work if possible and - for about 150.000 ukrainian students - adequate school places.<br />
    &#43;keeping EU together resisting fascists (Brexiteers, Orbans aso)<br />

100/ No, I never actually said "erase Germans"

Germans on the other hand, don't seem to be bothered by Ukrainians being "erased"

‚ùóÔ∏èUkrainians are fighting the Nazis, ok? Germans so far have mostly been paying those Nazis enabling them to carry on killing us.

    This is crazy.<br />
    <br />
    A Ukrainian refugee found Russian propaganda in her high-school textbook.<br />
    <br />
    It claims half of üá∫üá¶ is majority pro-Russian due to being Russian-speaking &amp; blames U.S.<br />

    Responsible? <br />
