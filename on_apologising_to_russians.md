Expectations for a Ukrainian: Apologise to russians.

This conversation happened in Twitter Spaces a couple days ago in front of 400 people. Sharing so it's easier to understand what I have to deal with every other day.

Featuring me being told that:

‚úÖ I need to apologize to russians
‚úÖ I am as bad as russians (multiple times)
‚úÖ I am an idiot
‚úÖ I am a hypocrite
‚úÖ I need to educate myself (highly suggested) 
‚úÖ I need to speak to someone because there is clearly something wrong with me

Just walked out of the Spaces again after trying to explain what happened last night and getting muted.

1) Yes, I CAN say that 140m russians are guilty of [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians). And I will. Because they are.
2) Telling a Ukrainian person about the suffering of russians   under putin's rule is a disgrace. You'll never see me in their spaces again. Just for the record, how many termobaric rockets have fallen on russian civilians recently for me to worry about them?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    I‚Äôll say it again. If you see someone experiencing horrific trauma, that is not the time to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù how they feel about their attacker. Give them space; let them be angry. They have reason to be. Let others have nuanced convos and debate, but don‚Äôt demand it of them right now. https://t.co/Z62D8InyeT<br />

So TLDR:

a man calls me all this. He's not interrupted a single time, I maintain composure while being called names and him yelling all sorts of abuse.

I, a Ukrainian person, come back to set the record straight - muted immediately. Actual joke.

A good way to prevent further "russophobia" that not many people like to talk about - instead of blaming Ukrainians, making russians stop. [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians)

There are two types of people when talking about russia:
1) people like Aaron
2) people who had their loved ones bombed in their sleep in their homes.

Silencing me is absolutely disgraceful considering how respectfully I behaved.

*comes in, gets to be called a morally bankrupt idiot again and listens about how she is wrong on every level*

I didn't have a fallout - a few hosts repeatedly tolerated me being publicly denigrated and then engaged in the same themselves + also started harrassing me in the spaces I was co-hosting with [@ndboulton](https://twitter.com/ndboulton).
