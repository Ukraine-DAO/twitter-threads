⚡️Introducing a "new" concept not familiar to russians and all genocide apologists:  Collective responsibility ⚡️

I also recommend to read this book. Lots of insights for people worrying about poor russians who have no idea what's happening and would do something if they could.

    33/ Deliberate neglect is standing by while something awful happens and doing little or nothing to stop it. But they&#39;re not just not stopping the genocide. They&#39;re happy about it. They don&#39;t understand why we don&#39;t love them. They &#34;can&#39;t do anything wrong&#34;. @CalinIonescu5<br />

Here you can learn about the mysterious russian soul, russian culture and other things they are proud of. You are welcome. I'm actually a big supporter of promoting russian culture,  except I want people to know what it really is.

I explained at great length here all the reasons for why I say what I say. Please read this 🧵 before coming up with a new "yes, but..." There is no "but". They are collectively responsible for [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) and we need to open our eyes on that.

    1/ Sorry but no, the 🇷🇺 literature is really not essential in understanding man. The nature of the &#34;mysterious 🇷🇺  soul&#34; can be seen in #Mariupol these days💔<br />

    🇺🇦 Instead I invite everyone to register for this Ukrainian Culture &amp; Literature course:<br />

    @cryptodrftng I&#39;d add one thing though. If you have an army of child rapists and instead of confronting it you under the pseudo-russky-patriotism umbrella resort to defending it, then you have a proven case of child rapists &amp; their enablers society. You are either for or against it.<br />

    @cryptodrftng It&#39;s mind-boggling. It&#39;s like if we&#39;re back in middle ages again. Seems like war criminals&#39; enablers can find multiple excuses for everything and anything just to avoid taking any responsibility. What&#39;s making it worse though is the fact that Westerners are involved as well.<br />

    @cryptodrftng Yes, all russians are collectively guilty of the russian military aggression against Ukraine, and the genocide. The russian society is radicalised, and hate speech against Ukrainians since 2014 is public and normalised. russia is fascist, both society &amp; state.<br />

    @cryptodrftng russians have a social contract with their &#34;horde chief&#34; in which they are not interested in politics in exchange for making russia &#34;great&#34; again. They choose authoritarianism, and they allow, enable and support putin&#39;s dictatorship, hate speech and aggression against Ukrainians.<br />
