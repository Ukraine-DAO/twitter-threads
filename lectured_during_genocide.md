Just called mum. 
"I still can't believe that all of this is real. 

That the world is watching it and letting it happen to us. 

It's like we're in the 40s of the last century again, but this time everyone can see it real time. How is this even possible?"

Meanwhile, Ukrainians, including myself, are being patronised and lectured every single day and told about how we "should not generalise" because "not all russians are like that". 
I want to ask everyone: where the fuck are those mythical "different russians?"

I have a few good russian friends and none of them, literally none of them, have an issue with me being mad at russians. Because they hate russia and everything it's about too. They don't have the arrogance to tell me how I should be feeling right now. And neither should you.

I speak and write in russian better than the vast majority of russians. I've read most of what's called "classical russian literature". I've met more russians in my life than all of the people lecturing me have, combined. Don't lecture me about who *most* russians are.

Just last night I was being yelled at in Twitter Spaces and told that “I’ve failed the test” by a German person. And you know what? There is no test that a German person can be lecturing me about. One needs to have close to sociopathic lack of self-awareness to even say that.

I was told some BS about polls, how there is a 2% increase in Germans who agree with Ukraine being delivered weapons, "realpolitik", “whether you like it or not”, “this is how the sausage is made”. 3 months into [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians), is the change in polls the best 🇩🇪 can do?

- 1.2m Ukrainians forcefully deported
- hundreds of children killed
- hundreds of thousands of war crimes
- over 3000 airstrikes
- my friends and family members live in bomb shelters

0 apologies from russians, germans or pretty much anyone else

Now, a little bit about "international law", "democracy" and other obscure terms that people who lack any self-awareness and empathy like to bring up.

As a qualified lawyer, I'd like to tell you - both are worth jack shit right now. 

Your "democracy" is russia's slut.

Next time you decide to be patronising to me or any Ukrainian person, please remind yourself that if you "support Ukraine" but it doesn't include actually hearing Ukrainians, we'll be better off without you. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk and [#ArmUkraineNow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArmUkraineNow) 🖤

Open Letter on the War in Ukraine

    I encourage everyone to read the open letter I published 3 days before the invasion. Every country has its propaganda, I’m not blind to that. But it’s 🇷🇺 propaganda that’s about to cause a global catastrophe. It has to be stopped before it’s too late.<br />

I could see and was trying to warn everyone that 🇷🇺 was becoming a fascist state since 2014. You're saying to me that the 🇪🇺 leaders, with all their intelligence info, did not see that? They did. But because it was about Ukraine, they didn't care. Greed for 💰 & power won.

🧵 about the importance of "not generalising" - common gaslighting technique that aims to make the victim feel guilty. I can see what people who use it are trying to do and have nothing to say to them except for that they can go fuck themselves

    If it&#39;s the feelings of russians that you&#39;re worrying about, I recommend to reevaluate your life values. https://t.co/iRPWCQ6Cg8<br />

Quick lesson on how to check whether what you say about 🇺🇦 makes sense:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    1/ Quick rule of thumb for &#34;experts&#34;: before saying something about Ukrainians and russian Nazis, replace them in the same sentence with &#34;Jewish people&#34; and &#34;German Nazis&#34; and consider if you&#39;d say that in public. If you wouldn&#39;t, then it&#39;s not appropriate. You&#39;re welcome. 🙂<br />

This is a very important point that I'd like to communicate to all the fake "pacifists", whose views "don't allow" them to support arming Ukraine:

There is a price you'll have to pay for everything you do and everything you don't do. Up to you.

If you stop paying russia for [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians) and help to [#ArmUkraineNow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArmUkraineNow), the benefit you get is that the russian bombs will keep falling on the Ukrainian land for some time - not on yours. 

If you think you are safe, I have bad news for you.

Also, while I have your attention - [@navalny](https://twitter.com/navalny) is not Ukraine's friend. He's not inspirational.

The only reason he doesn't like p*tin is because he's not in his place.

    Alternative scenario would be some liberal oppositionary taking the place of Putin. Such an oppositionary will be widely considered as a saviour or a redemptive figure.
