They'll never get over it because it's the core of "russian culture" and it's the same thing that makes them attack Ukraine:

"My life is shit but instead of trying to make it better I'm gonna go ruin someone else's to make me feel less miserable."

    @cryptodrftng What is the anti-LGBT thing in Russia? Is it just machismo? How long do you think it will take to get over it? It happened in the US during my lifetime. I would say it was unacceptable in 1985, but completely normal by 1998-2000.<br />
