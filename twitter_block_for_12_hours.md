I'm back and would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest apologies to [@Twitter](https://twitter.com/Twitter) for violating its rules by not being quiet about [#GenocideOfUkrainians](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenocideOfUkrainians). Super sorry, [@TwitterSupport](https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport), definitely will happen again - you can just remove my account if that's not cool.

Are Ukrainians seriously your biggest problem right now, [@Twitter](https://twitter.com/Twitter)? Thank god you guys didn't exist in Anne Frank's times - she'd be shadow banned and then "Account Suspended" would pop up to protect the Nazi's feelings and freedom of speech.

Not comparing myself to Anne Frank btw, no need for that - [@Twitter](https://twitter.com/Twitter) puts plenty of effort into suspending accounts of volunteers actually on the ground in Ukraine - [@MelaniePodolyak](https://twitter.com/MelaniePodolyak), for example. @ArmedForcesUkr blocked altogether. Great job ✊
